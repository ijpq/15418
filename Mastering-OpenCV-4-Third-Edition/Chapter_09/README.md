# Chapter 9: Finding the Best OpenCV Algorithm for the Job

Working with OpenCV, a computer vision engineer has many algorithmic options on hand to solve a given task. 
Making the right choice in an informed way is extremely important since it can have tremendous impact on the success of the entire solution, and prevent from boxing into a rigid implementation. 
This chapter will discuss some methods to follow when considering options within OpenCV. 
We will discuss the areas in computer vision that OpenCV covers, ways to select between competing algorithms if more than one exists, how to measure the success of an algorithm, and finally how to measure success in a robust way with a pipeline.

## Requirements
* Jupyter notebook
* OpenCV v4 with Python bindings installed

The most convenient way to get started is using Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/).

To initialize a new conda environment with OpenCV installed:

    $ conda create --name opencv_env
    $ conda activate opencv_env
    $ conda install opencv
    
Jupyter is automatically installed.

An alternative process: https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

## Building instructions

There are no particular build instructions.

## Running instructions

To run, navigate to this directory and run:

    $ jupyter notebook

And access the `.ipynb` file to start the notebook.
