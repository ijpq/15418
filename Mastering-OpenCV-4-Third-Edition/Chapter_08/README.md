# Chapter 8: iOS Panoramas with the Stitching Module

Panorama stitching became a handy tool in almost all digital cameras and mobile devices. 
Nowadays creating panoramas is as simple as swiping the device or camera across the view, the stitching calculations happen immediately and the final expanded scene is available for viewing. 
In this chapter we will implement a modest panoramic image stitching application on the iPhone using OpenCV's precompiled library for iOS. 

## Requirements
* Mac OSX machine (e.g. MacBook, iMac) running Mac OS High Sierra v10.13+
* iPhone 6+ running iOS v11+
* XCode v9+
* CocoaPods v1.5+: https://cocoapods.org/
* OpenCV v4.0 installed via CocoaPods

## Building instructions

To initialize the CocoaPods dependencies, run:
    
    $ pod install
    
Then open the XCode Workspace (not project), and build as usual in XCode.

## Running instruction

Run as a regular iOS project.
