# Chapter 6: Introduction to Web Computer Vision with OpenCV.js

This chapter introduces a new way to develop computer vision algorithms for the web. 
When a computer vision algorithm has to be written for the web, normally it is a C++ program on the server that is executed when a client calls it via a web server, but with OpenCV.js, this way to develop computer vision algorithms is extended not only on the server, but it's extended to the browser client. 
The algorithms can be executed in the client browser, allowing developers to have more flexibility and use the benefits of running code in the clients' browsers.

## Building the project

There is no need to build the project since it is already pre-built in JavaScript.

## Running the project

Simply open `index.html` in your browser, a web server is not needed for a local run.
