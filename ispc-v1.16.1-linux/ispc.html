<div id="content">
<p>The Intel® Implicit SPMD Program Compiler (Intel® ISPC) is a compiler for
writing SPMD (single program multiple data) programs to run on the CPU and GPU.
The SPMD
programming approach is widely known to graphics and GPGPU programmers; it
is used for GPU shaders and CUDA* and OpenCL* kernels, for example.  The
main idea behind SPMD is that one writes programs as if they were operating
on a single data element (a pixel for a pixel shader, for example), but
then the underlying hardware and runtime system executes multiple
invocations of the program in parallel with different inputs (the values
for different pixels, for example).</p>
<p>The main goals behind <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> are to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Build a variant of the C programming language that delivers good
performance to performance-oriented programmers who want to run SPMD
programs on CPUs and GPUs.</li>
<li>Provide a thin abstraction layer between the programmer and the
hardware--in particular, to follow the lesson from C for serial programs
of having an execution and data model where the programmer can cleanly
reason about the mapping of their source program to compiled assembly
language and the underlying hardware.</li>
<li>Harness the computational power of the Single Program, Multiple Data (SIMD) vector
units without the extremely low-programmer-productivity activity of directly
writing intrinsics.</li>
<li>Explore opportunities from close-coupling between C/C++ application code
and SPMD <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> code running on the same processor--lightweight function
calls between the two languages, sharing data directly via pointers without
copying or reformatting, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We are very interested in your feedback and comments about ispc and
in hearing your experiences using the system.  We are especially interested
in hearing if you try using ispc but see results that are not as you
were expecting or hoping for.</strong> We encourage you to send a note with your
experiences or comments to the <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/ispc-users">ispc-users</a> mailing list or to file bug or
feature requests with the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ispc/ispc/issues?state=open">bug tracker</a>. (Thanks!)</p>

<h1>Recent Changes to ISPC</h1>
<p>See the file <a class="reference external" href="https://raw.github.com/ispc/ispc/main/docs/ReleaseNotes.txt">ReleaseNotes.txt</a> in the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> distribution for a list
of recent changes to the compiler.</p>
<div class="section" id="updating-ispc-programs-for-changes-in-ispc-1-1">
<h2>Updating ISPC Programs For Changes In ISPC 1.1</h2>
<p>The major changes introduced in the 1.1 release of <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> are first-class
support for pointers in the language and new parallel loop constructs.
Adding this functionality required a number of syntactic changes to the
language.  These changes should generally lead to straightforward minor
modifications of existing <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> programs.</p>
<p>These are the relevant changes to the language:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The syntax for reference types has been changed to match C++'s syntax for
references and the <tt class="docutils literal">reference</tt> keyword has been removed.  (A diagnostic
message is issued if <tt class="docutils literal">reference</tt> is used.)<ul>
<li>Declarations like <tt class="docutils literal">reference float foo</tt> should be changed to <tt class="docutils literal">float &amp;foo</tt>.</li>
<li>Any array parameters in function declaration with a <tt class="docutils literal">reference</tt>
qualifier should just have <tt class="docutils literal">reference</tt> removed: <tt class="docutils literal">void foo(reference
float <span class="pre">bar[])</span></tt> can just be <tt class="docutils literal">void foo(float <span class="pre">bar[])</span></tt>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is now a compile-time error to assign an entire array to another
array.</li>
<li>A number of standard library routines have been updated to take
pointer-typed parameters, rather than references or arrays an index
offsets, as appropriate.  For example, the <tt class="docutils literal">atomic_add_global()</tt>
function previously took a reference to the variable to be updated
atomically but now takes a pointer.  In a similar fashion,
<tt class="docutils literal">packed_store_active()</tt> takes a pointer to a <tt class="docutils literal">uniform unsigned int</tt>
as its first parameter rather than taking a <tt class="docutils literal">uniform unsigned int[]</tt> as
its first parameter and a <tt class="docutils literal">uniform int</tt> offset as its second parameter.</li>
<li>It is no longer legal to pass a varying lvalue to a function that takes a
reference parameter; references can only be to uniform lvalue types.  In
this case, the function should be rewritten to take a varying pointer
parameter.</li>
<li>There are new iteration constructs for looping over computation domains,
<tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">foreach_tiled</tt>.  In addition to being syntactically
cleaner than regular <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> loops, these can provide performance
benefits in many cases when iterating over data and mapping it to program
instances.  See the Section <a class="reference internal" href="#parallel-iteration-statements-foreach-and-foreach-tiled">Parallel Iteration Statements: &quot;foreach&quot; and
&quot;foreach_tiled&quot;</a> for more information about these.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="updating-ispc-programs-for-changes-in-ispc-1-2">
<h2>Updating ISPC Programs For Changes In ISPC 1.2</h2>
<p>The following changes were made to the language syntax and semantics for
the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> 1.2 release:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Syntax for the &quot;launch&quot; keyword has been cleaned up; it's now no longer
necessary to bracket the launched function call with angle brackets. (In
other words, now use <tt class="docutils literal">launch <span class="pre">foo();</span></tt>, rather than <tt class="docutils literal">launch &lt; foo() &gt;;</tt>.)</li>
<li>When using pointers, the pointed-to data type is now &quot;uniform&quot; by
default.  Use the varying keyword to specify varying pointed-to types
when needed.  (i.e. <tt class="docutils literal">float *ptr</tt> is a varying pointer to uniform float
data, whereas previously it was a varying pointer to varying float
values.) Use <tt class="docutils literal">varying float *</tt> to specify a varying pointer to varying
float data, and so forth.</li>
<li>The details of &quot;uniform&quot; and &quot;varying&quot; and how they interact with struct
types have been cleaned up.  Now, when a struct type is declared, if the
struct elements don't have explicit &quot;uniform&quot; or &quot;varying&quot; qualifiers,
they are said to have &quot;unbound&quot; variability.  When a struct type is
instantiated, any unbound variability elements inherit the variability of
the parent struct type. See <a class="reference internal" href="#struct-types">Struct Types</a> for more details.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> has a new language feature that makes it much easier to use the
efficient &quot;(array of) structure of arrays&quot; (AoSoA, or SoA) memory layout
of data.  A new <tt class="docutils literal">soa&lt;n&gt;</tt> qualifier can be applied to structure types to
specify an n-wide SoA version of the corresponding type.  Array indexing
and pointer operations with arrays SoA types automatically handles the
two-stage indexing calculation to access the data.  See <a class="reference internal" href="#structure-of-array-types">Structure of
Array Types</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="updating-ispc-programs-for-changes-in-ispc-1-3">
<h2>Updating ISPC Programs For Changes In ISPC 1.3</h2>
<p>This release adds a number of new iteration constructs, which in turn use
new reserved words: <tt class="docutils literal">unmasked</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">foreach_unique</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">foreach_active</tt>,
and <tt class="docutils literal">in</tt>.  Any program that happens to have a variable or function with
one of these names must be modified to rename that symbol.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="updating-ispc-programs-for-changes-in-ispc-1-5-0">
<h2>Updating ISPC Programs For Changes In ISPC 1.5.0</h2>
<p>This release adds support for double precision floating point constants.
Double precision floating point constants are floating point number with
<tt class="docutils literal">d</tt> suffix and optional exponent part. Here are some examples: 3.14d,
31.4d-1, 1.d, 1.0d, 1d-2. Note that floating point number without suffix is
treated as single precision constant.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="updating-ispc-programs-for-changes-in-ispc-1-6-0">
<h2>Updating ISPC Programs For Changes In ISPC 1.6.0</h2>
<p>This release adds support for <a class="reference internal" href="#operators-overloading">Operators Overloading</a>, so a word <tt class="docutils literal">operator</tt>
becomes a keyword and it potentially creates a conflict with existing user
function. Also a new library function packed_store_active2() was introduced,
which also may create a conflict with existing user functions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="updating-ispc-programs-for-changes-in-ispc-1-7-0">
<h2>Updating ISPC Programs For Changes In ISPC 1.7.0</h2>
<p>This release contains several changes that may affect compatibility with
older versions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The algorithm for selecting overloaded functions was extended to cover more
types of overloading, and handling of reference types was fixed. At the same
time the old scheme, which blindly used the function with &quot;the best score&quot;
summed for all arguments, was switched to the C++ approach, which requires
&quot;the best score&quot; for each argument. If the best function doesn't exist, a
warning is issued in this version. It will be turned into an error in the
next version. A simple example: Suppose we have two functions: max(int, int)
and max(unsigned int, unsigned int). The new rules lead to an error when

<li>Implicit cast of pointer to const type to void* was disallowed. Use explicit

Linux* and macOS* available for download.  Alternatively, you can
download the source code from that page and build it yourself; see the

<p>Once you have an executable for your system, copy it into a directory
that's in your <tt class="docutils literal">PATH</tt>.  Congratulations--you've now installed <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="compiling-and-running-a-simple-ispc-program">
<h2>Compiling and Running a Simple ISPC Program</h2>
<p>The directory <tt class="docutils literal">examples/simple</tt> in the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> distribution includes a
simple example of how to use <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> with a short C++ program.  See the
file <tt class="docutils literal">simple.ispc</tt> in that directory (also reproduced here.)</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
export void simple(uniform float vin[], uniform float vout[],
                   uniform int count) {
    foreach (index = 0 ... count) {
        float v = vin[index];
        if (v &lt; 3.)
            v = v * v;
        else
            v = sqrt(v);
        vout[index] = v;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>This program loops over an array of values in <tt class="docutils literal">vin</tt> and computes an
output value for each one.  For each value in <tt class="docutils literal">vin</tt>, if its value is less
than three, the output is the value squared, otherwise it's the square root
of the value.</p>
<p>The first thing to notice in this program is the presence of the <tt class="docutils literal">export</tt>
keyword in the function definition; this indicates that the function should
be made available to be called from application code.  The <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt>
qualifiers on the parameters to <tt class="docutils literal">simple</tt> indicate that the corresponding
variables are non-vector quantities--this concept is discussed in detail in the
<a class="reference internal" href="#uniform-and-varying-qualifiers">&quot;uniform&quot; and &quot;varying&quot; Qualifiers</a> section.</p>
<p>Each iteration of the <tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt> loop works on a number of input values in
parallel--depending on the compilation target chosen, it may be 4, 8, 16, 32, or
even 64 elements of the <tt class="docutils literal">vin</tt> array, processed efficiently with the CPU's or
GPU's SIMD hardware.  Here, the variable <tt class="docutils literal">index</tt> takes all values from 0 to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">count-1</span></tt>.  After the load from the array to the variable <tt class="docutils literal">v</tt>, the
program can then proceed, doing computation and control flow based on the
values loaded.  The result from the running program instances is written to
the <tt class="docutils literal">vout</tt> array before the next iteration of the <tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt> loop runs.</p>
<p>To build and run examples go to <tt class="docutils literal">examples</tt> and create <tt class="docutils literal">build</tt> folder.
Run <tt class="docutils literal">cmake <span class="pre">-DISPC_EXECUTABLE=&lt;path_to_ispc_binary&gt;</span> ../</tt>. On Linux* and
macOS*, the makefile will be generated in that directory. On Windows*,
Microsoft Visual Studio solution <tt class="docutils literal">ispc_examples.sln</tt> will be created. In
either case, build it now! We'll walk through the details of the compilation
steps in the following section, <a class="reference internal" href="#using-the-ispc-compiler">Using The ISPC Compiler</a>.)  In addition to
compiling the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> program, in this case the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> compiler also
generates a small header file, <tt class="docutils literal">simple.h</tt>.  This header file includes the
declaration for the C-callable function that the above <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> program is
compiled to.  The relevant parts of this file are:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern &quot;C&quot; {
#endif // __cplusplus
    extern void simple(float vin[], float vout[], int32_t count);
#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif // __cplusplus
</pre>
<p>It's not mandatory to <tt class="docutils literal">#include</tt> the generated header file in your C/C++
code (you can alternatively use a manually-written <tt class="docutils literal">extern</tt> declaration
of the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> functions you use), but it's a helpful check to ensure that
the function signatures are as expected on both sides.</p>
<p>Here is the main program, <tt class="docutils literal">simple.cpp</tt>, which calls the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> function
above.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &quot;simple.h&quot;

int main() {
    float vin[16], vout[16];
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 16; ++i)
        vin[i] = i;

    simple(vin, vout, 16);

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 16; ++i)
        printf(&quot;%d: simple(%f) = %f\n&quot;, i, vin[i], vout[i]);
}
</pre>
<p>Note that the call to the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> function in the middle of <tt class="docutils literal">main()</tt> is
a regular function call.  (And it has the same overhead as a C/C++ function
call, for that matter.)</p>
<p>When the executable <tt class="docutils literal">simple</tt> runs, it generates the expected output:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
0: simple(0.000000) = 0.000000
1: simple(1.000000) = 1.000000
2: simple(2.000000) = 4.000000
3: simple(3.000000) = 1.732051
...
</pre>
<p>For a slightly more complex example of using <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>, see the <a class="reference external" href="http://ispc.github.io/example.html">Mandelbrot
set example</a> page on the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> website for a walk-through of an <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>
implementation of that algorithm.  After reading through that example, you

<div class="section" id="using-the-ispc-compiler">
<h1>Using The ISPC Compiler</h1>
<p>To go from a <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> source file to an object file that can be linked
with application code, enter the following command</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
ispc foo.ispc -o foo.o
</pre>
<p>(On Windows, you may want to specify <tt class="docutils literal">foo.obj</tt> as the output filename.)</p>
<div class="section" id="basic-command-line-options">
<h2>Basic Command-line Options</h2>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> executable can be run with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--help</span></tt> to print a list of
accepted command-line arguments.  By default, the compiler compiles the
provided program (and issues warnings and errors), but doesn't
generate any output.</p>
<p>If the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-o</span></tt> flag is given, it will generate an output file (a native
object file by default).</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
ispc foo.ispc -o foo.obj
</pre>
<p>To generate a text assembly file, pass <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--emit-asm</span></tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
ispc foo.ispc -o foo.asm --emit-asm
</pre>
<p>To generate LLVM bitcode, use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--emit-llvm</span></tt> flag.
To generate LLVM bitcode in textual form, use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--emit-llvm-text</span></tt> flag.</p>
<p>Optimizations are on by default; they can be turned off with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-O0</span></tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
ispc foo.ispc -o foo.obj -O0
</pre>
<p>There is support for generating debugging symbols; this is enabled with the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-g</span></tt> command-line flag.  Using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-g</span></tt> doesn't affect optimization level;
to debug unoptimized code pass <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-O0</span></tt> flag.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-h</span></tt> flag can also be used to direct <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> to generate a C/C++
header file that includes C/C++ declarations of the C-callable <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>
functions and the types passed to it.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-D</span></tt> option can be used to specify definitions to be passed along to
the pre-processor, which runs over the program input before it's compiled.
For example, including <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-DTEST=1</span></tt> defines the pre-processor symbol
<tt class="docutils literal">TEST</tt> to have the value <tt class="docutils literal">1</tt> when the program is compiled.</p>
<p>The compiler issues a number of performance warnings for code constructs
that compile to relatively inefficient code.  These warnings can be
silenced with the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--wno-perf</span></tt> flag (or by using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--woff</span></tt>, which turns
off all compiler warnings.)  Furthermore, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--werror</span></tt> can be provided to
direct the compiler to treat any warnings as errors.</p>
<p>Position-independent code (for use in shared libraries) is generated if the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--pic</span></tt> command-line argument is provided.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="selecting-the-compilation-target">
<h2>Selecting The Compilation Target</h2>
<p>There are four options that affect the compilation target: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--arch</span></tt>,
which sets the target architecture, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--cpu</span></tt>, which sets the target CPU or GPU,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--target</span></tt>, which sets the target instruction set, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--target-os</span></tt>,
which sets the target operating system.</p>
<p>If none of these options is specified, <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> generates code for the host
OS and for the architecture of the system the compiler is running on (i.e.
64-bit x86-64 (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--arch=x86-64</span></tt>) on x86 systems and ARM NEON on ARM systems.</p>
<p>To compile to a 32-bit x86 target, for example, supply <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--arch=x86</span></tt> on
the command line:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
ispc foo.ispc -o foo.obj --arch=x86
</pre>
<p>To compile for Intel TGLLP platform:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
ispc foo.ispc -o foo.bin --target=genx-x16 --cpu=TGLLP --emit-zebin
</pre>
<p>Currently-supported architectures are <tt class="docutils literal">x86</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x86-64</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">genx32</tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal">genx64</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">arm</tt>.</p>
<p>The target CPU determines both the default instruction set used as well as
which CPU architecture the code is tuned for.  <tt class="docutils literal">ispc <span class="pre">--help</span></tt> provides a
list of all of the supported CPUs.  By default, the CPU type of the system
on which you're running <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> is used to determine the target CPU.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
ispc foo.ispc -o foo.obj --cpu=corei7-avx
</pre>
<p>Next, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--target</span></tt> selects the target instruction set.  The target
string is of the form <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[ISA]-i[mask</span> size]x[gang size]</tt>.  For example,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--target=avx2-i32x16</span></tt> specifies a target with the AVX2 instruction set,
a mask size of 32 bits, and a gang size of 16.</p>
<p>The following target ISAs are supported:</p>

<p>Consult your CPU's manual for specifics on which vector instruction set it
supports.</p>
<p>The mask size may be 8, 16, or 32 bits, though not all combinations of ISAs
and mask sizes are supported.  For best performance, the best general
approach is to choose a mask size equal to the size of the most common
datatype in your programs.  For example, if most of your computation is on
32-bit floating-point values, an <tt class="docutils literal">i32</tt> target is appropriate.  However,
if you're mostly doing computation on 8-bit images, <tt class="docutils literal">i8</tt> is a better choice.</p>
<p>See <a class="reference internal" href="#basic-concepts-program-instances-and-gangs-of-program-instances">Basic Concepts: Program Instances and Gangs of Program Instances</a> for
more discussion of the &quot;gang size&quot; and its implications for program
execution.</p>
<p>Running <tt class="docutils literal">ispc <span class="pre">--help</span></tt> and looking at the output for the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--target</span></tt>
option gives the most up-to-date documentation about which targets your

<p>By default, the target instruction set is chosen based on the most capable
one supported by the system on which you're running <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>.  You can
override this choice with the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--target</span></tt> flag; for example, to select

<p>Finally, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--target-os</span></tt> selects the target operating system. Depending on
your host <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> may support Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS and PS4
targets. Running <tt class="docutils literal">ispc <span class="pre">--help</span></tt> and looking at the output for the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--target-os</span></tt>

calculations, even when using a 64-bit compilation target like x86-64.
This implementation approach can provide substantial performance benefits
by reducing the cost of addressing calculations.  (Note that pointers
themselves are still maintained as 64-bit quantities for 64-bit targets.)</p>
<p>If you need to be able to address more than 4GB of memory from your
<tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> programs, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--addressing=64</span></tt> command-line argument can be
provided to cause the compiler to generate 64-bit arithmetic for addressing
calculations.  Note that it is safe to mix object files where some were
compiled with the default <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--addressing=32</span></tt> and others were compiled with
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--addressing=64</span></tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-preprocessor">
<h2>The Preprocessor</h2>

<h2>Debugging</h2>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-g</span></tt> command-line flag can be supplied to the compiler, which causes
it to generate debugging symbols.  The debug info is emitted in DWARF format
on Linux* and macOS*.  The version of the DWARF can be controlled by
command-line switch <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--dwarf-version={2,3,4}</span></tt>.  On Windows* CodeView format
is used (not PDB), it's natively supported by Microsoft Visual Studio*.
Running <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> programs in the debugger, setting breakpoints, printing out
variables is just the same as debugging C/C++ programs.  Similarly, you can
directly step up and down the call stack between <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> code and C/C++
code.</p>
<p>One limitation of the current debugging support is that the debugger
provides a window into an entire gang's worth of program instances, rather
than just a single program instance.  (These concepts will be introduced
shortly, in <a class="reference internal" href="#basic-concepts-program-instances-and-gangs-of-program-instances">Basic Concepts: Program Instances and Gangs of Program Instances</a>
). Thus, when a <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt> variable is printed, the values for
each of the program instances are displayed.  Along similar lines, the path
the debugger follows through program source code passes each statement that
any program instance wants to execute (see <a class="reference internal" href="#control-flow-within-a-gang">Control Flow Within A Gang</a>
for more details on control flow in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>.)</p>
<p>While debugging, a variable, <tt class="docutils literal">__mask</tt>, is available to provide the
current program execution mask at the current point in the program</p>
<p>Another option for debugging is
to use the <tt class="docutils literal">print</tt> statement for <tt class="docutils literal">printf()</tt> style debugging.  (See
<a class="reference internal" href="#output-functions">Output Functions</a> for more information.)  You can also use the ability to
call back to application code at particular points in the program, passing
a set of variable values to be logged or otherwise analyzed from there.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-ways-of-passing-arguments-to-ispc">
<h2>Other ways of passing arguments to ISPC</h2>
<p>In addition to specifying arguments on the command line, if the <tt class="docutils literal">ISPC_ARGS</tt>
environment variable has been set it is split into arguments and these arguments
are appended to any provided on the command line.</p>
<p>It is also possible to pass arguments to <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> in a file. If an argument has
the form <tt class="docutils literal">&#64;&lt;filename&gt;</tt>, where <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;filename&gt;</tt> exists and is readable, it is
replaced with the content of the file split into arguments. Note that it <em>is</em>
allowed for a file to contain a further <tt class="docutils literal">&#64;&lt;filename&gt;</tt> argument.</p>
<p>Where a file or environment variable is split into arguments, this is done based on
the arguments being separated by one or more whitespace characters, including tabs
and newlines. There is no means of escaping or quoting a character to allow an
argument to contain a whitespace character.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-ispc-parallel-execution-model">
<h1>The ISPC Parallel Execution Model</h1>
<p>Though <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> is a C-based language, it is inherently a language for
parallel computation.  Understanding the details of <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>'s parallel
execution model that are introduced in this section is critical for writing
efficient and correct programs in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> supports two types of parallelism: task parallelism to parallelize
across multiple processor cores and SPMD parallelism to parallelize across
the SIMD vector lanes on a single core.  Most of this section focuses on
SPMD parallelism, but see <a class="reference internal" href="#tasking-model">Tasking Model</a> at the end of this section for
discussion of task parallelism in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>.</p>
<p>This section will use some snippets of <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> code to illustrate various
concepts.  Given <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>'s relationship to C, these should be
understandable on their own, but you may want to refer to the <a class="reference internal" href="#the-ispc-language">The ISPC
Language</a> section for details on language syntax.</p>
<div class="section" id="basic-concepts-program-instances-and-gangs-of-program-instances">
<h2>Basic Concepts: Program Instances and Gangs of Program Instances</h2>
<p>Upon entry to a <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> function called from C/C++ code, the execution
model switches from the application's serial model to <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>'s execution
model.  Conceptually, a number of <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> <em>program instances</em> start
running concurrently.  The group of running program instances is a
called a <em>gang</em> (harkening to &quot;gang scheduling&quot;, since <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> provides
certain guarantees about the control flow coherence of program instances
running in a gang, detailed in <a class="reference internal" href="#gang-convergence-guarantees">Gang Convergence Guarantees</a>.)  An
<tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> program instance is thus similar to a CUDA* &quot;thread&quot; or an OpenCL*
&quot;work-item&quot;, and an <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> gang is similar to a CUDA* &quot;warp&quot;.</p>
<p>An <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> program expresses the computation performed by a gang of
program instances, using an &quot;implicit parallel&quot; model, where the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>
program generally describes the behavior of a single program instance, even
though a gang of them is actually executing together.  This implicit model
is the same that is used for shaders in programmable graphics pipelines,
OpenCL* kernels, and CUDA*.  For example, consider the following <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>
function:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float func(float a, float b) {
     return a + b / 2.;
}
</pre>
<p>In C, this function describes a simple computation on two individual
floating-point values.  In <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>, this function describes the
computation to be performed by each program instance in a gang.  Each
program instance has distinct values for the variables <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">b</tt>, and
thus each program instance generally computes a different result when
executing this function.</p>
<p>The gang of program instances starts executing in the same hardware thread
and context as the application code that called the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> function; no
thread creation or context switching is done under the covers by <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>.
Rather, the set of program instances is mapped to the SIMD lanes of the
current processor, leading to excellent utilization of hardware SIMD units
and high performance.</p>
<p>The number of program instances in a gang is relatively small; in practice,
it's no more than 2-4x the native SIMD width of the hardware it is
executing on.  Thus, four or eight program instances in a gang on a CPU
using the 4-wide SSE instruction set, eight or sixteen on a CPU
using 8-wide AVX/AVX2, eight, sixteen, thirty two, or sixty four on AVX512 CPU,
and eight or sixteen on a Intel GPU.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="control-flow-within-a-gang">
<h2>Control Flow Within A Gang</h2>
<p>Almost all the standard control-flow constructs are supported by <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>;
program instances are free to follow different program execution paths than
other ones in their gang.  For example, consider a simple <tt class="docutils literal">if</tt> statement
in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> code:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float x = ..., y = ...;
if (x &lt; y) {
   // true statements
}
else {
   // false statements
}
</pre>
<p>In general, the test <tt class="docutils literal">x &lt; y</tt> may have different result for different
program instances in the gang: some of the currently running program
instances want to execute the statements for the &quot;true&quot; case and some want
to execute the statements for the &quot;false&quot; case.</p>
<p>Complex control flow in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> programs generally works as expected,
computing the same results for each program instance in a gang as would
have been computed if the equivalent code ran serially in C to compute each
program instance's result individually.  However, here we will more
precisely define the execution model for control flow in order to be able
to precisely define the language's behavior in specific situations.</p>
<p>We will specify the notion of a <em>program counter</em> and how it is updated to
step through the program, and an <em>execution mask</em> that indicates which
program instances want to execute the instruction at the current program
counter.  The program counter is shared by all of the
program instances in the gang; it points to a single instruction to be
executed next.  The execution mask is a per-program-instance boolean value
that indicates whether or not side effects from the current instruction
should effect each program instance.  Thus, for example, if a statement
were to be executed with an &quot;all off&quot; mask, there should be no observable
side-effects.</p>
<p>Upon entry to an <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> function called by the application, the execution
mask is &quot;all on&quot; and the program counter points at the first statement in
the function.  The following two statements describe the required behavior
of the program counter and the execution mask over the course of execution
of an <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> function.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. The program counter will have a sequence of values corresponding to a
conservative execution path through the function, wherein if <em>any</em>
program instance wants to execute a statement, the program counter will
pass through that statement.</p>
<p>2. At each statement the program counter passes through, the execution
mask will be set such that its value for a particular program instance is
&quot;on&quot; if and only if the program instance wants to execute that statement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that these definitions provide the compiler some latitude; for example,
the program counter is allowed to pass through a series of statements with the
execution mask &quot;all off&quot; because doing so has no observable side-effects.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we will speak informally of the <em>control flow coherence</em> of a
program; this notion describes the degree to which the program instances in
the gang want to follow the same control flow path through a function (or,
conversely, whether most statements are executed with a &quot;mostly on&quot;
execution mask or a &quot;mostly off&quot; execution mask.)  In general, control flow
divergence leads to reductions in SIMD efficiency (and thus performance) as
different program instances want to perform different computations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="control-flow-example-if-statements">
<h2>Control Flow Example: If Statements</h2>
<p>As a concrete example of the interplay between program counter and
execution mask, one way that an <tt class="docutils literal">if</tt> statement like the one in the
previous section can be represented is shown by the following pseudo-code
compiler output:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float x = ..., y = ...;
bool test = (x &lt; y);
mask originalMask = get_current_mask();
set_mask(originalMask &amp; test);
if (any_mask_entries_are_enabled()) {
  // true statements
}
set_mask(originalMask &amp; ~test);
if (any_mask_entries_are_enabled()) {
  // false statements
}
set_mask(originalMask);
</pre>
<p>In other words, the program counter steps through the statements for both
the &quot;true&quot; case and the &quot;false&quot; case, with the execution mask set so that
no side-effects from the true statements affect the program instances that
want to run the false statements, and vice versa.  However, a block of
statements does not execute if the mask is &quot;all off&quot; upon entry to that
block.  The execution mask is then restored to the value it had before the
<tt class="docutils literal">if</tt> statement.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="control-flow-example-loops">
<h2>Control Flow Example: Loops</h2>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">for</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">while</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">do</tt> statements are handled in an analogous
fashion.  The program counter continues to run additional iterations of the
loop until all of the program instances are ready to exit the loop.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we have a loop like the following:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int limit = ...;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; limit; ++i) {
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>where <tt class="docutils literal">limit</tt> has the value 1 for all of the program instances but one,
and has value 1000 for the other one, the program counter will step through
the loop body 1000 times.  The first time, the execution mask will be all
on (assuming it is all on going into the <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> loop), and the remaining
999 times, the mask will be off except for the program instance with a
<tt class="docutils literal">limit</tt> value of 1000.  (This would be a loop with poor control flow
coherence!)</p>
<p>A <tt class="docutils literal">continue</tt> statement in a loop may be handled either by disabling the
execution mask for the program instances that execute the <tt class="docutils literal">continue</tt> and
then continuing to step the program counter through the rest of the loop,
or by jumping to the loop step statement, if all program instances are
disabled after the <tt class="docutils literal">continue</tt> has executed.  <tt class="docutils literal">break</tt> statements are
handled in a similar fashion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="gang-convergence-guarantees">
<h2>Gang Convergence Guarantees</h2>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> execution model provides an important guarantee about the
behavior of the program counter and execution mask: the execution of
program instances is <em>maximally converged</em>.  Maximal convergence means that
if two program instances follow the same control path, they are guaranteed
to execute each program statement concurrently. If two program instances
follow diverging control paths, it is guaranteed that they will reconverge
as soon as possible in the function (if they do later reconverge). <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a></p>
<table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id2" rules="none">
<colgroup><col class="label" /><col /></colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id1">[1]</a></td><td>This is another significant difference between the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>
execution model and the one implemented by OpenCL* and CUDA*, which
doesn't provide this guarantee.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Maximal convergence means that in the presence of divergent control flow
such as the following:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
if (test) {
  // true
}
else {
  // false
}
</pre>
<p>It is guaranteed that all program instances that were running before the
<tt class="docutils literal">if</tt> test will also be running after the end of the <tt class="docutils literal">else</tt> block.
(This guarantee stems from the notion of having a single program counter
for the gang of program instances, rather than the concept of a unique
program counter for each program instance.)</p>
<p>Another implication of this property is that it would be illegal for the
<tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> implementation to execute a function with an 8-wide gang by
running it two times, with a 4-wide gang representing half of the original
8-wide gang each time.</p>
<p>It also follows that given the following program:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
if (programIndex == 0) {
    while (true)  // infinite loop
        ;
}
print(&quot;hello, world\n&quot;);
</pre>
<p>the program will loop infinitely and the <tt class="docutils literal">print</tt> statement will never be
executed.  (A different execution model that allowed gang divergence might
execute the <tt class="docutils literal">print</tt> statement since not all program instances were caught
in the infinite loop in the example above.)</p>
<p>The way that &quot;varying&quot; function pointers are handled in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> is also
affected by this guarantee: if a function pointer is <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt>, then it
has a possibly-different value for all running program instances.  Given a
call to a varying function pointer, <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> must maintain as much
execution convergence as possible; the assembly code generated finds the
set of unique function pointers over the currently running program
instances and calls each one just once, such that the executing program
instances when it is called are the set of active program instances that
had that function pointer value.  The order in which the various function
pointers are called in this case is undefined.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="uniform-data">
<h2>Uniform Data</h2>
<p>A variable that is declared with the <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> qualifier represents a
single value that is shared across the entire gang.  (In contrast, the
default variability qualifier for variables in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt>,
represents a variable that has a distinct storage location for each program
instance in the gang.)  (Though see the discussion in <a class="reference internal" href="#struct-types">Struct Types</a> for
some subtleties related to <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt> when used with
structures.)</p>
<p>It is an error to try to assign a <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt> value to a <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt>
variable, though <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> values can be assigned to <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt>
variables.  Assignments to <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> variables are not affected by the
execution mask (there's no unambiguous way that they could be); rather,
they always apply if the program counter pointer passes through a statement
that is a <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> assignment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="uniform-control-flow">
<h2>Uniform Control Flow</h2>
<p>One advantage of declaring variables that are shared across the gang as
<tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt>, when appropriate, is the reduction in storage space required.
A more important benefit is that it can enable the compiler to generate
substantially better code for control flow; when a test condition for a
control flow decision is based on a <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> quantity, the compiler can
be immediately aware that all of the running program instances will follow
the same path at that point, saving the overhead of needing to deal with
control flow divergence and mask management.  (To distinguish the two forms
of control flow, will say that control flow based on <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt>
expressions is &quot;varying&quot; control flow.)</p>
<p>Consider for example an image filtering operation where the program loops
over pixels adjacent to the given (x,y) coordinates:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float box3x3(uniform float image[32][32], int x, int y) {
    float sum = 0;
    for (int dy = -1; dy &lt;= 1; ++dy)
        for (int dx = -1; dx &lt;= 1; ++dx)
            sum += image[y+dy][x+dx];
    return sum / 9.;
}
</pre>
<p>In general each program instance in the gang has different values for <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal">y</tt> in this function.  For the box filtering algorithm here, all of
the program instances will actually want to execute the same number of
iterations of the <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> loops, with all of them having the same values
for <tt class="docutils literal">dx</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">dy</tt> each time through.  If these loops are instead
implemented with <tt class="docutils literal">dx</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">dy</tt> declared as <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> variables, then
the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> compiler can generate more efficient code for the loops. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id3">[2]</a></p>
<table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id4" rules="none">
<colgroup><col class="label" /><col /></colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id3">[2]</a></td><td>In this case, a sufficiently smart compiler could determine that
<tt class="docutils literal">dx</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">dy</tt> have the same value for all program instances and thus
generate more optimized code from the start, though this optimization
isn't yet implemented in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>.</td></tr>

    for (uniform int dx = -1; dx &lt;= 1; ++dx)
        sum += image[y+dy][x+dx];
</pre>
<p>In particular, <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> can avoid the overhead of checking to see if any of
the running program instances wants to do another loop iteration.  Instead,
the compiler can generate code where all instances always do the same
iterations.</p>
<p>The analogous benefit comes when using <tt class="docutils literal">if</tt> statements--if the test in an
<tt class="docutils literal">if</tt> statement is based on a <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> test, then the result will by
definition be the same for all of the running program instances.  Thus, the
code for only one of the two cases needs to execute.  <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> can generate
code that jumps to one of the two, avoiding the overhead of needing to run
the code for both cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="uniform-variables-and-varying-control-flow">
<h2>Uniform Variables and Varying Control Flow</h2>
<p>Recall that in the presence of varying control flow, both the &quot;true&quot; and
&quot;false&quot; clauses of an <tt class="docutils literal">if</tt> statement may be executed, with the side
effects of the instructions masked so that they only apply to the program
instances that are supposed to be executing the corresponding clause.
Under this model, we must define the effect of modifying <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt>
variables in the context of varying control flow.</p>
<p>In general, modifying <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> variables under varying control flow
leads to the <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> variable having a value that depends on whether
any of the program instances in the gang followed a particular execution
path.  Consider the following example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float a = ...;
uniform int b = 0;
if (a == 0) {
    ++b;
    // b is 1
}
else {
    b = 10;
    // b is 10
}
// whether b is 1 or 10 depends on whether any of the values
// of &quot;a&quot; in the executing gang were 0.
</pre>
<p>Here, if any of the values of <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> across the gang was non-zero, then
<tt class="docutils literal">b</tt> will have a value of 10 after the <tt class="docutils literal">if</tt> statement has executed.
However, if all of the values of <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> in the currently-executing program
instances at the start of the <tt class="docutils literal">if</tt> statement had a value of zero, then
<tt class="docutils literal">b</tt> would have a value of 1.</p>

<div class="section" id="data-races-within-a-gang">
<h2>Data Races Within a Gang</h2>
<p>In order to be able to write well-formed programs where program instances
depend on values that are written to memory by other program instances
within their gang, it's necessary to have a clear definition of when
side-effects from one program instance become visible to other program
instances running in the same gang.</p>
<p>In the model implemented by <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>, any side effect from one program
instance is visible to other program instances in the gang after the next
sequence point in the program. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id5">[3]</a></p>
<table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id6" rules="none">
<colgroup><col class="label" /><col /></colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id5">[3]</a></td><td>This is a significant difference between <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> and SPMD languages
like OpenCL* and CUDA*, which require barrier synchronization among the
running program instances with functions like <tt class="docutils literal">barrier()</tt> or
<tt class="docutils literal">__syncthreads()</tt>, respectively, to ensure this condition.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Generally, sequence points include the end of a full expression, before a
function is entered in a function call, at function return, and at the end
of initializer expressions.  The fact that there is no sequence point
between the increment of <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> and the assignment to <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> in <tt class="docutils literal">i=i++</tt> is
why the effect that expression is undefined in C, for example.  See, for
example, the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_point">Wikipedia page on sequence points</a> for more information
about sequence points in C and C++.</p>
<p>In the following example, we have declared an array of values <tt class="docutils literal">v</tt>, with
one value for each running program instance.  In the below, assume that
<tt class="docutils literal">programCount</tt> gives the gang size, and the <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt> integer value
<tt class="docutils literal">programIndex</tt> indexes into the running program instances starting from
zero.  (Thus, if 8 program instances are running, the first one of them
will have a value 0, the next one a value of 1, and so forth up to 7.)</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int x = ...;
uniform int tmp[programCount];
tmp[programIndex] = x;
int neighbor = tmp[(programIndex+1)%programCount];
</pre>
<p>In this code, the running program instances have written their values of
<tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> into the <tt class="docutils literal">tmp</tt> array such that the ith element of <tt class="docutils literal">tmp</tt> is equal
to the value of <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> for the ith program instance.  Then, the program
instances load the value of <tt class="docutils literal">neighbor</tt> from <tt class="docutils literal">tmp</tt>, accessing the value
written by their neighboring program instance (wrapping around to the first
one at the end.)  This code is well-defined and without data races, since
the writes to and reads from <tt class="docutils literal">tmp</tt> are separated by a sequence point.</p>
<p>(For this particular application of communicating values from one program
instance to another, there are more efficient built-in functions in the
<tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> standard library; see <a class="reference internal" href="#cross-program-instance-operations">Cross-Program Instance Operations</a> for
more information.)</p>
<p>It is possible to write code that has data races across the gang of program
instances.  For example, if the following function is called with multiple
program instances having the same value of <tt class="docutils literal">index</tt>, then it is undefined
which of them will write their value of <tt class="docutils literal">value</tt> to <tt class="docutils literal">array[index]</tt>.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
void assign(uniform int array[], int index, int value) {
    array[index] = value;
}
</pre>
<p>As another example, if the values of the array indices <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">j</tt> have
the same values for some of the program instances, and an assignment like
the following is performed:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int i = ..., j = ...;
uniform int array[...] = { ... };
array[i] = array[j];
</pre>
<p>then the program's behavior is undefined, since there is no sequence point
between the reads and writes to the same location.</p>
<p>While this rule that says that program instances can safely depend on
side-effects from by other program instances in their gang eliminates a
class of synchronization requirements imposed by some other SPMD languages,
it conversely means that it is possible to write <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> programs that
compute different results when run with different gang sizes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tasking-model">
<h2>Tasking Model</h2>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> provides an asynchronous function call (i.e. tasking) mechanism
through the <tt class="docutils literal">launch</tt> keyword.  (The syntax is documented in the <a class="reference internal" href="#task-parallelism-launch-and-sync-statements">Task
Parallelism: &quot;launch&quot; and &quot;sync&quot; Statements</a> section.)  A function called
with <tt class="docutils literal">launch</tt> executes asynchronously from the function that called it;
it may run immediately or it may run concurrently on another processor in
the system, for example.</p>
<p>If a function launches multiple tasks, there are no guarantees about the
order in which the tasks will execute.  Furthermore, multiple launched
tasks from a single function may execute concurrently.</p>
<p>A function that has launched tasks may use the <tt class="docutils literal">sync</tt> keyword to force
synchronization with the launched functions; <tt class="docutils literal">sync</tt> causes a function to
wait for all of the tasks it has launched to finish before execution
continues after the <tt class="docutils literal">sync</tt>.  (Note that <tt class="docutils literal">sync</tt> only waits for the tasks
launched by the current function, not tasks launched by other functions).</p>
<p>Alternatively, when a function that has launched tasks returns, an implicit
<tt class="docutils literal">sync</tt> waits for all launched tasks to finish before allowing the
function to return to its calling function.  This feature is important
since it enables parallel composition: a function can call second function
without needing to be concerned if the second function has launched
asynchronous tasks or not--in either case, when the second function
returns, the first function can trust that all of its computation has
completed.</p>

<h1>The ISPC Language</h1>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> is an extended version of the C programming language, providing a
number of new features that make it easy to write high-performance SPMD
programs for the CPU and GPU.  Note that between not only the few small syntactic
differences between <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> and C code but more importantly <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>'s
fundamentally parallel execution model, C code can't just be recompiled to
correctly run in parallel with <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>.  However, starting with working C
code and porting it to <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> can be an efficient way to quickly write
<tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> programs.</p>
<p>This section describes the syntax and semantics of the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> language.
To understand how to use <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>, you need to understand both the language
syntax and <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>'s parallel execution model, which was described in the
previous section, <a class="reference internal" href="#the-ispc-parallel-execution-model">The ISPC Parallel Execution Model</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="relationship-to-the-c-programming-language">
<h2>Relationship To The C Programming Language</h2>
<p>This subsection summarizes the differences between <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> and C; if you
are already familiar with C, you may find it most effective to focus on
this subsection and just focus on the topics in the remainder of section
that introduce new language features.  You may also find it helpful to
compare the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> and C++ implementations of various algorithms in the
<tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> <tt class="docutils literal">examples/</tt> directory to get a sense of the close relationship
between <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> and C.</p>
<p>Specifically, C89 is used as the baseline for comparison in this subsection
(this is also the version of C described in the Second Edition of Kernighan
and Ritchie's book).  (<tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> adopts some features from C99 and from C++,
which will be highlighted in the below.)</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> has the same syntax and features for the following as is present
in C:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Expression syntax and basic types</li>
<li>Syntax for variable declarations</li>
<li>Control flow structures: <tt class="docutils literal">if</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">while</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">do</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">switch</tt>.</li>
<li>Pointers, including function pointers, <tt class="docutils literal">void *</tt>, and C's array/pointer
duality (arrays are converted to pointers when passed to functions, etc.)</li>
<li>Structs and arrays</li>
<li>Support for recursive function calls</li>
<li>Support for separate compilation of source files</li>
<li>&quot;Short-circuit&quot; evaluation of <tt class="docutils literal">||</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">&amp;&amp;</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">? :</tt> operators</li>
<li>The preprocessor</li>
</ul>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> adds a number of features from C++ and C99 to this base:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A boolean type, <tt class="docutils literal">bool</tt>, as well as built-in <tt class="docutils literal">true</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">false</tt>
values</li>
<li>Reference types (e.g. <tt class="docutils literal">const float &amp;foo</tt>)</li>
<li>Comments delimited by <tt class="docutils literal">//</tt></li>
<li>Variables can be declared anywhere in blocks, not just at their start.</li>
<li>Iteration variables for <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> loops can be declared in the <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt>
statement itself (e.g. <tt class="docutils literal">for (int i = 0; ...</tt>)</li>
<li>The <tt class="docutils literal">inline</tt> qualifier to indicate that a function should be inlined</li>
<li>Function overloading by parameter type</li>
<li>Hexadecimal floating-point constants</li>
<li>Dynamic memory allocation with <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">delete</tt>.</li>
<li>Limited support for overloaded operators (<a class="reference internal" href="#operators-overloading">Operators Overloading</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> also adds a number of new features that aren't in C89, C99, or
C++:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Parallel <tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">foreach_tiled</tt> iteration constructs (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#parallel-iteration-statements-foreach-and-foreach-tiled">Parallel Iteration Statements: &quot;foreach&quot; and &quot;foreach_tiled&quot;</a>)</li>
<li>The <tt class="docutils literal">foreach_active</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">foreach_unique</tt> iteration constructs, which
provide ways of iterating over subsets of the program instances in the
gang.  See <a class="reference internal" href="#iteration-over-active-program-instances-foreach-active">Iteration over active program instances: &quot;foreach_active&quot;</a>
and <a class="reference internal" href="#iteration-over-unique-elements-foreach-unique">Iteration over unique elements: &quot;foreach_unique&quot;</a>.)</li>
<li>Language support for task parallelism (see <a class="reference internal" href="#task-parallel-execution">Task Parallel Execution</a>)</li>
<li>&quot;Coherent&quot; control flow statements that indicate that control flow is
expected to be coherent across the running program instances (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#coherent-control-flow-statements-cif-and-friends">&quot;Coherent&quot; Control Flow Statements: &quot;cif&quot; and Friends</a>)</li>
<li>A rich standard library, though one that is different than C's (see <a class="reference internal" href="#the-ispc-standard-library">The
ISPC Standard Library</a>.)</li>
<li>Short vector types (see <a class="reference internal" href="#short-vector-types">Short Vector Types</a>)</li>
<li>Syntax to specify integer constants as bit vectors (e.g. <tt class="docutils literal">0b1100</tt> is 12)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of features of C89 that are not supported in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>
but are likely to be supported in future releases:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>There are no types named <tt class="docutils literal">char</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">short</tt>, or <tt class="docutils literal">long</tt> (or <tt class="docutils literal">long

<tt class="docutils literal">int64</tt> types</li>
<li>Character constants</li>
<li>String constants and arrays of characters as strings</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">goto</tt> statements are partially supported (see <a class="reference internal" href="#unstructured-control-flow-goto">Unstructured Control Flow: &quot;goto&quot;</a>)</li>

<li>Literal floating-point constants (even without a <tt class="docutils literal">f</tt> suffix) are
currently treated as being <tt class="docutils literal">float</tt> type, not <tt class="docutils literal">double</tt>. To have a double
precision floating point constant use <tt class="docutils literal">d</tt> suffix.</li>
<li>The <tt class="docutils literal">volatile</tt> qualifier</li>
<li>The <tt class="docutils literal">register</tt> storage class for variables.  (Will be ignored).</li>
</ul>
<p>The following C89 features are not expected to be supported in any future
<tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> release:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;K&amp;R&quot; style function declarations</li>
<li>The C standard library</li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="lexical-structure">
<h2>Lexical Structure</h2>
<p>Tokens in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> are delimited by white-space and comments.  The
white-space characters are the usual set of spaces, tabs, and carriage
returns/line feeds.  Comments can be delineated with <tt class="docutils literal">//</tt>, which starts a
comment that continues to the end of the line, or the start of a comment
can be delineated with <tt class="docutils literal">/*</tt> at the start and with <tt class="docutils literal">*/</tt> at the end.
Like C/C++, comments can't be nested.</p>
<p>Identifiers in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> are sequences of characters that start with an
underscore or an upper-case or lower-case letter, and then followed by
zero or more letters, numbers, or underscores.  Identifiers that start with
two underscores are reserved for use by the compiler.</p>
<p>Integer numeric constants can be specified in base 10, hexadecimal, or
binary.  (Octal integer constants aren't supported).  Base 10 constants are
given by a sequence of one or more digits from 0 to 9.  Hexadecimal
constants are denoted by a leading <tt class="docutils literal">0x</tt> and then one or more digits from
0-9, a-f, or A-F.  Finally, binary constants are denoted by a leading
<tt class="docutils literal">0b</tt> and then a sequence of 1s and 0s.</p>
<p>Here are three ways of specifying the integer value &quot;15&quot;:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int fifteen_decimal = 15;
int fifteen_hex     = 0xf;
int fifteen_binary  = 0b1111;
</pre>
<p>A number of suffixes can be provided with integer numeric constants.
First, &quot;u&quot; denotes that the constant is unsigned, and &quot;ll&quot; denotes a 64-bit
integer constant (while &quot;l&quot; denotes a 32-bit integer constant).  It is also
possible to denote units of 1024, 1024*1024, or 1024*1024*1024 with the
SI-inspired suffixes &quot;k&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, and &quot;G&quot; respectively:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int two_kb = 2k;   // 2048
int two_megs = 2M; // 2 * 1024 * 1024
int one_gig = 1G;  // 1024 * 1024 * 1024
</pre>
<p>Floating-point constants can be specified in one of three ways.  First,
they may be a sequence of zero or more digits from 0 to 9, followed by a
period, followed by zero or more digits from 0 to 9. (There must be at
least one digit before or after the period).</p>
<p>The second option is scientific notation, where a base value is specified
as the first form of a floating-point constant but is then followed by an
&quot;e&quot; or &quot;E&quot;, then a plus sign or a minus sign, and then an exponent.</p>
<p>Finally, floating-point constants may be specified as hexadecimal
constants; this form can ensure a perfectly bit-accurate representation of
a particular floating-point number.  These are specified with an &quot;0x&quot;
prefix, followed by a zero or a one, a period, and then the remainder of
the mantissa in hexadecimal form, with digits from 0-9, a-f, or A-F.  The
start of the exponent is denoted by a &quot;p&quot;, which is then followed by an
optional plus or minus sign and then digits from 0 to 9.  For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float two = 0x1p+1;  // 2.0
float pi  = 0x1.921fb54442d18p+1;  // 3.1415926535...
float neg = -0x1.ffep+11;  // -4095.
</pre>
<p>Floating-point constants can optionally have a &quot;f&quot; or &quot;F&quot; suffix (<tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>
currently treats all floating-point constants as having 32-bit precision,
making this suffix not currently have an effect.)</p>
<p>String constants in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> are denoted by an opening double quote <tt class="docutils literal">&quot;</tt>
followed by any character other than a newline, up to a closing double
quote.  Within the string, a number of special escape sequences can be used
to specify special characters.  These sequences all start with an initial
<tt class="docutils literal">\</tt> and are listed below:</p>

<h2>Types</h2>

<div class="section" id="basic-types-and-type-qualifiers">
<h2>Basic Types and Type Qualifiers</h2>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> is a statically-typed language.  It supports a variety of core
basic types:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">void</tt>: &quot;empty&quot; type representing no value.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">bool</tt>: boolean value; may be assigned <tt class="docutils literal">true</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">false</tt>, or the
value of a boolean expression.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">int8</tt>: 8-bit signed integer.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">unsigned int8</tt>: 8-bit unsigned integer; may also be specified as <tt class="docutils literal">uint8</tt>.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">int16</tt>: 16-bit signed integer.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">unsigned int16</tt>: 16-bit unsigned integer; may also be specified as <tt class="docutils literal">uint16</tt>.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">int</tt>: 32-bit signed integer; may also be specified as <tt class="docutils literal">int32</tt>.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">unsigned int</tt>: 32-bit unsigned integer; may also be specified as
<tt class="docutils literal">unsigned int32</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">uint32</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">uint</tt>.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">float</tt>: 32-bit floating point value</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">int64</tt>: 64-bit signed integer.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">unsigned int64</tt>: 64-bit unsigned integer; may also be specified as <tt class="docutils literal">uint64</tt>.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">double</tt>: 64-bit double-precision floating point value.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also a few built-in types related to pointers and memory:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">size_t</tt>: the maximum size of any object (structure or array)</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">ptrdiff_t</tt>: an integer type large enough to represent the difference
between two pointers</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">intptr_t</tt>: signed integer type that is large enough to represent
a pointer value</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">uintptr_t</tt>: unsigned integer type large enough to represent a pointer</li>
</ul>
<p>Implicit type conversion between values of different types is done
automatically by the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> compiler.  Thus, a value of <tt class="docutils literal">float</tt> type
can be assigned to a variable of <tt class="docutils literal">int</tt> type directly.  In binary
arithmetic expressions with mixed types, types are promoted to the &quot;more
general&quot; of the two types, with the following precedence:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
double &gt; uint64 &gt; int64 &gt; float &gt; uint32 &gt; int32 &gt;
    uint16 &gt; int16 &gt; uint8 &gt; int8 &gt; bool
</pre>
<p>In other words, adding an <tt class="docutils literal">int64</tt> to a <tt class="docutils literal">double</tt> causes the <tt class="docutils literal">int64</tt> to
be converted to a <tt class="docutils literal">double</tt>, the addition to be performed, and a
<tt class="docutils literal">double</tt> value to be returned.  If a different conversion behavior is
desired, then explicit type-casts can be used, where the destination type
is provided in parenthesis around the expression:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
double foo = 1. / 3.;
int bar = (float)bar + (float)bar;  // 32-bit float addition
</pre>
<p>If a <tt class="docutils literal">bool</tt> is converted to an integer numeric type (<tt class="docutils literal">int</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">int64</tt>,
etc.), then the result is a non-zero value if the <tt class="docutils literal">bool</tt> has the value
<tt class="docutils literal">true</tt> and has the value zero otherwise. A <tt class="docutils literal">bool</tt> with value <tt class="docutils literal">true</tt>
is not guaranteed to be one if converted to an integer numeric type.</p>
<p>Variables can be declared with the <tt class="docutils literal">const</tt> qualifier, which prohibits
their modification.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
const float PI = 3.1415926535;
</pre>
<p>As in C, the <tt class="docutils literal">extern</tt> qualifier can be used to declare a function or
global variable defined in another source file, and the <tt class="docutils literal">static</tt>
qualifier can be used to define a variable or function that is only visible
in the current scope.  The values of <tt class="docutils literal">static</tt> variables declared in
functions are preserved across function calls.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="uniform-and-varying-qualifiers">
<h2>&quot;uniform&quot; and &quot;varying&quot; Qualifiers</h2>
<p>If a variable has a <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> qualifier, then there is only a single
instance of that variable shared by all program instances in a gang.  (In
other words, it necessarily has the same value across all of the program
instances.)  In addition to requiring less storage than varying values,
<tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> variables lead to a number of performance advantages when they
are applicable (see <a class="reference internal" href="#uniform-control-flow">Uniform Control Flow</a>, for example.)  Varying
variables may be qualified with <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt>, though doing so has no effect,
as <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt> is the default.</p>
<p>There are two exceptions for this rule described in <a class="reference internal" href="#pointer-types">Pointer Types</a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="#type-casting">Type Casting</a> sections.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> variables can be modified as the program executes, but only in
ways that preserve the property that they have a single value for the
entire gang.  Thus, it's legal to add two uniform variables together and
assign the result to a uniform variable, but assigning a non-<tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt>
(i.e., <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt>) value to a <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> variable is a compile-time
error.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> variables implicitly type-convert to varying types as required:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform int x = ...;
int y = ...;
int z = x * y;  // x is converted to varying for the multiply
</pre>
<p>Arrays themselves aren't uniform or varying, but the elements that they
store are:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float foo[10];
uniform float bar[10];
</pre>
<p>The first declaration corresponds to 10 gang-wide <tt class="docutils literal">float</tt> values in
memory, while the second declaration corresponds to 10 <tt class="docutils literal">float</tt> values.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="defining-new-names-for-types">
<h2>Defining New Names For Types</h2>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">typedef</tt> keyword can be used to name types:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
typedef int64 BigInt;
typedef float Float3[3];
</pre>
<p>Following C's syntax, the code above defines <tt class="docutils literal">BigInt</tt> to have <tt class="docutils literal">int64</tt>
type and <tt class="docutils literal">Float3</tt> to have <tt class="docutils literal">float[3]</tt> type.</p>
<p>Also as in C, <tt class="docutils literal">typedef</tt> doesn't create a new type: it just provides an
alternative name for an existing type.  Thus, in the above example, it is
legal to pass a value with <tt class="docutils literal">float[3]</tt> type to a function that has been
declared to take a <tt class="docutils literal">Float3</tt> parameter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pointer-types">
<h2>Pointer Types</h2>
<p>It is possible to have pointers to data in memory; pointer arithmetic,
changing values in memory with pointers, and so forth is supported as in C.
As with other basic types, pointers can be both <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt>.</p>
<p>** Like other types in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>, pointers are <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt> by default, if an
explicit <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> qualifier isn't provided.  However, the default
variability of the pointed-to type is uniform. ** This rule will be
illustrated and explained in examples below.</p>
<p>For example, the <tt class="docutils literal">ptr</tt> variable in the code below is a varying pointer to
<tt class="docutils literal">uniform float</tt> values.  Each program instance has a separate pointer
value and the assignment to <tt class="docutils literal">*ptr</tt> generally represents a scatter to
memory.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform float a[] = ...;
int index = ...;
float * ptr = &amp;a[index];
*ptr = 1;
</pre>
<p>A <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> pointer can be declared with an appropriately-placed
qualifier:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float f = 0;
varying float * uniform pf = &amp;f;  // uniform pointer to a varying float
*pf = 1;
</pre>
<p>The placement of the <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> qualifier to declare a <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> pointer
may be initially surprising, but it matches the form of how, for example, a
pointer that is itself <tt class="docutils literal">const</tt> (as opposed to pointing to a <tt class="docutils literal">const</tt>
type) is declared in C.  (Reading the declaration from right to left gives
its meaning: a uniform pointer to a float that is varying.)</p>
<p>A subtlety comes in in cases like the where a uniform pointer points to a
varying datatype.  In this case, each program instance accesses a distinct
location in memory (because the underlying varying datatype is itself laid
out with a separate location in memory for each program instance.)</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float a;
varying float * uniform pa = &amp;a;
*pa = programIndex;  // same as (a = programIndex)
</pre>
<p>Also as in C, arrays are silently converted into pointers:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float a[10] = { ... };
varying float * uniform pa = a;     // pointer to first element of a
varying float * uniform pb = a + 5; // pointer to 5th element of a
</pre>
<p>Any pointer type can be explicitly typecast to another pointer type, as
long as the source type isn't a <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt> pointer when the destination
type is a <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> pointer.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float *pa = ...;
int *pb = (int *)pa;  // legal, but beware
</pre>
<p>Like other types, <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> pointers can be typecast to be <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt>
pointers, however.</p>
<p>Any pointer type can be assigned to a <tt class="docutils literal">void</tt> pointer without a type cast:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float foo(void *);
int *bar = ...;
foo(bar);
</pre>
<p>There is a special <tt class="docutils literal">NULL</tt> value that corresponds to a NULL pointer.  As a
special case, the integer value zero can be implicitly converted to a NULL
pointer and pointers are implicitly converted to boolean values in
conditional expressions.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
void foo(float *ptr) {
    if (ptr != 0) { // or, (ptr != NULL), or just (ptr)
       ...
</pre>
<p>It is legal to explicitly type-cast a pointer type to an integer type and
back from an integer type to a pointer type.  Note that this  conversion
isn't performed implicitly, for example for function calls.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="function-pointer-types">
<h2>Function Pointer Types</h2>
<p>Pointers to functions can also be taken and used as in C and C++.
The syntax for declaring function pointer types is the same as in those
languages; it's generally easiest to use a <tt class="docutils literal">typedef</tt> to help:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int inc(int v) { return v+1; }
int dec(int v) { return v-1; }

typedef int (*FPType)(int);
FPType fptr = inc;  // vs. int (*fptr)(int) = inc;
</pre>
<p>Given a function pointer, the function it points to can be called:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int x = fptr(1);
</pre>
<p>It's not necessary to take the address of a function to assign it to a
function pointer or to dereference it to call the function.</p>
<p>As with pointers to data in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>, function pointers can be either
<tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt>.  A call through a <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> causes all of the
running program instances in the gang to call into the target function; the
implications of a call through a <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt> function pointer are discussed
in the section <a class="reference internal" href="#gang-convergence-guarantees">Gang Convergence Guarantees</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reference-types">
<h2>Reference Types</h2>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> also provides reference types (like C++ references) that can be
used for passing values to functions by reference, allowing functions can
return multiple results or modify existing variables.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
void increment(float &amp;f) {
    ++f;
}
</pre>
<p>As in C++, once a reference is bound to a variable, it can't be rebound
to a different variable:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float a = ..., b = ...;
float &amp;r = a;  // makes r refer to a
r = b;  // assigns b to a, doesn't make r refer to b
</pre>
<p>An important limitation with references in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> is that references
can't be bound to varying lvalues; doing so causes a compile-time error to
be issued.  This situation is illustrated in the following code, where
<tt class="docutils literal">vptr</tt> is a <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt> pointer type (in other words, there each program
instance in the gang has its own unique pointer value)</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform float * uniform uptr = ...;
float &amp;ra = *uptr;  // ok
uniform float * varying vptr = ...;
float &amp;rb = *vptr;  // ERROR: *ptr is a varying lvalue type
</pre>
<p>(The rationale for this limitation is that references must be represented
as either a uniform pointer or a varying pointer internally.  While
choosing a varying pointer would provide maximum flexibility and eliminate
this restriction, it would reduce performance in the common case where a
uniform pointer is all that's needed.  As a work-around, a varying pointer
can be used in cases where a varying lvalue reference would be desired.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="enumeration-types">
<h2>Enumeration Types</h2>
<p>It is possible to define user-defined enumeration types in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> with
the <tt class="docutils literal">enum</tt> keyword, which is followed by an optional enumeration type name
and then a brace-delimited list of enumerators with optional values:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
enum Color { RED, GREEN, BLUE };
enum Flags {
    UNINITIALIZED = 0,
    INITIALIZED = 2,
    CACHED = 4
};
</pre>
<p>Each <tt class="docutils literal">enum</tt> declaration defines a new type; an attempt to implicitly
convert between enumerations of different types gives a compile-time error,
but enumerations of different types can be explicitly cast to one other.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Color c = (Color)CACHED;
</pre>
<p>Enumerators are implicitly converted to integer types, however, so they can
be directly passed to routines that take integer parameters and can be used
in expressions including integers, for example.  However, the integer
result of such an expression must be explicitly cast back to the enumerant
type if it to be assigned to a variable with the enumerant type.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Color c = RED;
int nextColor = c+1;
c = (Color)nextColor;
</pre>
<p>In this particular case, the explicit cast could be avoided using an
increment operator.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Color c = RED;
++c;  // c == GREEN now
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="short-vector-types">
<h2>Short Vector Types</h2>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> supports a parameterized type to define short vectors.  These
short vectors can only be used with basic types like <tt class="docutils literal">float</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">int</tt>;
they can't be applied to arrays or structures.  Note: <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> does <em>not</em>
use these short vectors to facilitate program vectorization; they are
purely a syntactic convenience.  Using them or writing the corresponding
code without them shouldn't lead to any noticeable performance differences
between the two approaches.</p>
<p>Syntax similar to C++ templates is used to declare these types:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float&lt;3&gt; foo;   // vector of three floats
double&lt;6&gt; bar;
</pre>
<p>The length of these vectors can be arbitrarily long, though the expected
usage model is relatively short vectors.</p>
<p>You can use <tt class="docutils literal">typedef</tt> to create types that don't carry around
the brackets around the vector length:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
typedef float&lt;3&gt; float3;
</pre>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> doesn't support templates in general.  In particular,
not only must the vector length be a compile-time constant, but it's
also not possible to write functions that are parameterized by vector
length.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform int i = foo();
// ERROR: length must be compile-time constant
float&lt;i&gt; vec;
// ERROR: can't write functions parameterized by vector length
float&lt;N&gt; func(float&lt;N&gt; val);
</pre>
<p>Arithmetic on these short vector types works as one would expect; the
operation is applied component-wise to the values in the vector.  Here is a
short example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float&lt;3&gt; func(float&lt;3&gt; a, float&lt;3&gt; b) {
    a += b;    // add individual elements of a and b
    a *= 2.;   // multiply all elements of a by 2
    bool&lt;3&gt; test = a &lt; b;  // component-wise comparison
    return test ? a : b;   // return each minimum component
}
</pre>
<p>As shown by the above code, scalar types automatically convert to
corresponding vector types when used in vector expressions.  In this
example, the constant <tt class="docutils literal">2.</tt> above is converted to a three-vector of 2s for
the multiply in the second line of the function implementation.</p>
<p>Type conversion between other short vector types also works as one would
expect, though the two vector types must have the same length:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float&lt;3&gt; foo = ...;
int&lt;3&gt; bar = foo;    // ok, cast elements to ints
int&lt;4&gt; bat = foo;    // ERROR: different vector lengths
float&lt;4&gt; bing = foo; // ERROR: different vector lengths
</pre>
<p>For convenience, short vectors can be initialized with a list of individual
element values:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float x = ..., y = ..., z = ...;
float&lt;3&gt; pos = { x, y, z };
</pre>
<p>There are two mechanisms to access the individual elements of these short
vector data types.  The first is with the array indexing operator:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float&lt;4&gt; foo;
for (uniform int i = 0; i &lt; 4; ++i)
    foo[i] = i;
</pre>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> also provides a specialized mechanism for naming and accessing
the first few elements of short vectors based on an overloading of
the structure member access operator.  The syntax is similar to that used
in HLSL, for example.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float&lt;3&gt; position;
position.x = ...;
position.y = ...;
position.z = ...;
</pre>
<p>More specifically, the first element of any short vector type can be
accessed with <tt class="docutils literal">.x</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">.r</tt>, the second with <tt class="docutils literal">.y</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">.g</tt>, the third
with <tt class="docutils literal">.z</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">.b</tt>, and the fourth with <tt class="docutils literal">.w</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">.a</tt>.  Just like
using the array indexing operator with an index that is greater than the
vector size, accessing an element that is beyond the vector's size is
undefined behavior and may cause your program to crash.</p>
<p>It is also possible to construct new short vectors from other short vector
values using this syntax, extended for &quot;swizzling&quot;.  For example,</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float&lt;3&gt; position = ...;
float&lt;3&gt; new_pos = position.zyx;  // reverse order of components
float&lt;2&gt; pos_2d = position.xy;
</pre>
<p>Though a single element can be assigned to, as in the examples above, it is
not currently possible to use swizzles on the left-hand side of assignment
expressions:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int8&lt;2&gt; foo = ...;
int8&lt;2&gt; bar = ...;
foo.yz = bar;   // Error: can't assign to left-hand side of expression
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="array-types">
<h2>Array Types</h2>
<p>Arrays of any type can be declared just as in C and C++:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float a[10]; // array of 10 varying floats
uniform int * varying b[20]; // array of 20 varying pointers to uniform int
</pre>
<p>Multidimensional arrays can be specified as arrays of arrays; the following
declares an array of 5 arrays of 15 floats.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform float a[5][15];
</pre>
<p>The size of arrays must be a compile-time constant, though array size can
be determined from array initializer lists; see the following section,
<a class="reference internal" href="#declarations-and-initializers">Declarations and Initializers</a>, for details.  One exception to this is
that functions can be declared to take &quot;unsized arrays&quot; as parameters:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
void foo(float array[], int length);
</pre>
<p>Finally, the name of an array will be automatically implicitly converted to
a uniform pointer to the array type if needed:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform int a[10];
int * uniform ap = a;
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="struct-types">
<h2>Struct Types</h2>
<p>Aggregate data structures can be built using <tt class="docutils literal">struct</tt>.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
struct Foo {
    float time;
    int flags[10];
};
</pre>
<p>As in C++, after a <tt class="docutils literal">struct</tt> is declared, an instance can be created using
the <tt class="docutils literal">struct</tt>'s name:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Foo f;
</pre>
<p>Alternatively, <tt class="docutils literal">struct</tt> can be used before the structure name:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
struct Foo f;
</pre>
<p>Members in a structure declaration may each have <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt>
qualifiers, or may have no rate qualifier, in which case their variability
is initially &quot;unbound&quot;.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
struct Bar {
    uniform int a;
    varying int b;
    int c;
};
</pre>
<p>In the declaration above, the variability of <tt class="docutils literal">c</tt> is unbound.  The
variability of struct members that are unbound is resolved when a struct is
defined; if the <tt class="docutils literal">struct</tt> is <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt>, then unbound members are
<tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt>, and if the <tt class="docutils literal">struct</tt> is <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt>, then unbound members are
varying.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Bar vb;
uniform Bar ub;
</pre>
<p>Here, <tt class="docutils literal">b</tt> is a <tt class="docutils literal">varying Bar</tt> (since <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt> is the default
variability).  If <tt class="docutils literal">Bar</tt> is defined as above, then <tt class="docutils literal">vb.a</tt> is still a
<tt class="docutils literal">uniform int</tt>, since its varaibility was bound in the original
declaration of the <tt class="docutils literal">Bar</tt> type.  Similarly, <tt class="docutils literal">vb.b</tt> is <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt>.  The
variability of <tt class="docutils literal">vb.c</tt> is <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt>, since <tt class="docutils literal">vb</tt> is <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt>.</p>
<p>(Similarly, <tt class="docutils literal">ub.a</tt> is <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">ub.b</tt> is <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">ub.c</tt>
is <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt>.)</p>
<p>In most cases, it's worthwhile to declare <tt class="docutils literal">struct</tt> members with unbound
variability so that all have the same variability for both <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt> structs.  In particular, if a <tt class="docutils literal">struct</tt> has a member with
bound <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> type, it's not possible to index into an array of the
struct type with a <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt> index.  Consider the following example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
struct Foo { uniform int a; };
uniform Foo f[...] = ...;
int index = ...;
Foo fv = f[index];  // ERROR
</pre>
<p>Here, the <tt class="docutils literal">Foo</tt> type has a member with bound <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> variability.
Because <tt class="docutils literal">index</tt> has a different value for each program instance in the
above code, the value of <tt class="docutils literal">f[index]</tt> needs to be able to store a different
value of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Foo::a</span></tt> for each program instance.  However, a <tt class="docutils literal">varying Foo</tt>
still has only a single <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> member, since <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> was declared with
<tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> variability in the declaration of <tt class="docutils literal">Foo</tt>.  Therefore, the
indexing operation in the last line results in an error.</p>

<h2>Operators Overloading</h2>
<p>ISPC has limited support for overloaded operators for <tt class="docutils literal">struct</tt> types. Only
binary operators are supported currently, namely they are: <tt class="docutils literal">*, /, %, +, <span class="pre">-,</span> &gt;&gt;
and &lt;&lt;</tt>. Operators overloading support is similar to the one in C++ language.
To overload an operator for <tt class="docutils literal">struct S</tt>, you need to declare and implement a
function using keyword <tt class="docutils literal">operator</tt>, which accepts two parameters of type
<tt class="docutils literal">struct S</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">struct S&amp;</tt> and returns either of these types. For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
struct S { float re, im;};
struct S operator*(struct S a, struct S b) {
    struct S result;
    result.re = a.re * b.re - a.im * b.im;
    result.im = a.re * b.im + a.im * b.re;
    return result;
}

void foo(struct S a, struct S b) {
    struct S mul = a*b;
    print(&quot;a.re:   %\na.im:   %\n&quot;, a.re, a.im);
    print(&quot;b.re:   %\nb.im:   %\n&quot;, b.re, b.im);
    print(&quot;mul.re: %\nmul.im: %\n&quot;, mul.re, mul.im);
}

<div class="section" id="structure-of-array-types">
<h2>Structure of Array Types</h2>
<p>If data can be laid out in memory so that the executing program instances
access it via loads and stores of contiguous sections of memory, overall
performance can be improved noticably.  One way to improve this memory
access coherence is to lay out structures in &quot;structure of arrays&quot; (SOA)
format in memory; the benefits from SOA layout are discussed in more detail
in the <a class="reference external" href="perfguide.html#use-structure-of-arrays-layout-when-possible">Use &quot;Structure of Arrays&quot; Layout When Possible</a> section in the
ispc Performance Guide.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> provides two key language-level capabilities for laying out and
accessing data in SOA format:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>An <tt class="docutils literal">soa</tt> keyword that transforms a regular <tt class="docutils literal">struct</tt> into an SOA version
of the struct.</li>
<li>Array indexing syntax for SOA arrays that transparently handles SOA
indexing.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, consider a simple struct declaration:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
struct Point { float x, y, z; };
</pre>
<p>With the <tt class="docutils literal">soa</tt> rate qualifier, an array of SOA variants of this structure
can be declared:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
soa&lt;8&gt; Point pts[...];
</pre>
<p>The in-memory layout of the <tt class="docutils literal">Point</tt> instances has had the SOA transformation
applied, such that there are 8 <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> values in memory followed by 8 <tt class="docutils literal">y</tt>
values, and so forth.  Here is the effective declaration of <tt class="docutils literal">soa&lt;8&gt;
Point</tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
struct { uniform float x[8], y[8], z[8]; };
</pre>
<p>Given an array of SOA data, array indexing (and pointer arithmetic) is done
so that the appropriate values from the SOA array are accessed.  For
example, given:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
soa&lt;8&gt; Point pts[...];
uniform float x = pts[10].x;
</pre>
<p>The generated code effectively accesses the second 8-wide SOA structure and
then loads the third <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> value from it.  In general, one can write the
same code to access arrays of SOA elements as one would write to access
them in AOS layout.</p>
<p>Note that it directly follows from SOA layout that the layout of a single
element of the array isn't contiguous in memory--<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pts[1].x</span></tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pts[1].y</span></tt> are separated by 7 <tt class="docutils literal">float</tt> values in the above example.</p>
<p>There are a few limitations to the current implementation of SOA types in
<tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>; these may be relaxed in future releases:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It's illegal to typecast to <tt class="docutils literal">soa</tt> data to <tt class="docutils literal">void</tt> pointers.</li>
<li>Reference types are illegal in SOA structures</li>
<li>All members of SOA structures must have no rate qualifiers--specifically,
it's illegal to have an explicitly-qualified <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt>
member of a structure that has <tt class="docutils literal">soa</tt> applied to it.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="declarations-and-initializers">
<h2>Declarations and Initializers</h2>
<p>Variables are declared and assigned just as in C:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float foo = 0, bar[5];
float bat = func(foo);
</pre>
<p>More complex declarations are also possible:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
void (*fptr_array[16])(int, int);
</pre>
<p>Here, <tt class="docutils literal">fptr_array</tt> is an array of 16 pointers to functions that have
<tt class="docutils literal">void</tt> return type and take two <tt class="docutils literal">int</tt> parameters.</p>
<p>If a variable is declared without an initializer expression, then its value
is undefined until a value is assigned to it.  Reading an undefined
variable is undefined behavior.</p>
<p>Any variable that is declared at file scope (i.e. outside a function) is a
global variable.  If a global variable is qualified with the <tt class="docutils literal">static</tt>
keyword, then its only visible within the compilation unit in which it was
defined.  As in C/C++, a variable with a <tt class="docutils literal">static</tt> qualifier inside a
functions maintains its value across function invocations.</p>
<p>As in C++, variables don't need to be declared at the start of a basic
block:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int foo = ...;
if (foo &lt; 2) { ... }
int bar = ...;
</pre>
<p>Variables can also be declared in <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> statement initializers:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
for (int i = 0; ...)
</pre>
<p>Varying variables can be initialized with individual element values in braces.
The number of values has to be equal to the target width. So, static varying
initialization is not portable across targets with different widths unless
guarded with <tt class="docutils literal">#if TARGET_WIDTH</tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#if TARGET_WIDTH == 4
    varying int bar = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
#elif TARGET_WIDTH == 8
    varying int bar = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 };
#elif TARGET_WIDTH == 16
    ...
#endif
</pre>
<p>Arrays can be initialized with individual element values in braces:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int bar[2][4] = { { 1, 2, 3, 4 }, { 5, 6, 7, 8 } };
</pre>
<p>An array with an initializer expression can be declared with some or all of
its dimensions unspecified.  In this case, the &quot;shape&quot; of the initializer
expression is used to determine the array dimensions:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
// This corresponds to bar[2][4], due to the initializer expression
int bar[][] = { { 1, 2, 3, 4 }, { 5, 6, 7, 8 } };
</pre>
<p>Structures can also be initialized by providing element values in braces:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
struct Color { float r, g, b; };
....
Color d = { 0.5, .75, 1.0 }; // r = 0.5, ...
</pre>
<p>Arrays of structures and arrays inside structures can be initialized with
the expected syntax:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
struct Foo { int x; float bar[3]; };
Foo fa[2] = { { 1, { 2, 3, 4 } }, { 10, { 20, 30, 40 } } };
// now, fa[1].bar[2] == 40, and so forth
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="expressions">
<h2>Expressions</h2>
<p>All of the operators from C that you'd expect for writing expressions are
present.  Rather than enumerating all of them, here is a short summary of
the range of them available in action.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
unsigned int i = 0x1234feed;
unsigned int j = (i &lt;&lt; 3) ^ ~(i - 3);
i += j / 6;
float f = 1.234e+23;
float g = j * f / (2.f * i);
double h = (g &lt; 2) ? f : g/5;
</pre>
<p>Structure member access and array indexing also work as in C.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
struct Foo { float f[5]; int i; };
Foo foo = { { 1,2,3,4,5 }, 2 };
return foo.f[4] - foo.i;
</pre>
<p>The address-of operator, pointer dereference operator, and pointer member
operator also work as expected.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
struct Foo { float a, b, c; };
Foo f;
Foo * uniform fp = &amp;f;
(*fp).a = 0;
fp-&gt;b = 1;
</pre>
<p>As in C and C++, evaluation of the <tt class="docutils literal">||</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">&amp;&amp;</tt> logical operators as
well as the selection operator <tt class="docutils literal">? :</tt> is &quot;short-circuited&quot;; the right hand
side won't be evaluated if the value from the left-hand side determines the
logical operator's value.  For example, in the following code,
<tt class="docutils literal">array[index]</tt> won't be evaluated for values of <tt class="docutils literal">index</tt> that are
greater than or equal to <tt class="docutils literal">NUM_ITEMS</tt>.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
if (index &lt; NUM_ITEMS &amp;&amp; array[index] &gt; 0) {
    // ...
}
</pre>
<p>Short-circuiting may impose some overhead in the generated code; for cases
where short-circuiting is undesirable due to performance impact, see
the section <a class="reference internal" href="#logical-and-selection-operations">Logical and Selection Operations</a>, which introduces helper
functions in the standard library that provide these operations without
short-circuiting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dynamic-memory-allocation">
<h2>Dynamic Memory Allocation</h2>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> programs can dynamically allocate (and free) memory, using syntax
based on C++'s <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">delete</tt> operators:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int count = ...;
int *ptr = new int[count];
// use ptr...
delete[] ptr;
</pre>
<p>In the above code, each program instance allocates its own <tt class="docutils literal">count</tt> sized
array of <tt class="docutils literal">uniform int</tt> values, uses that memory, and then deallocates
that memory.  Uses of <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">delete</tt> in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> programs are
implemented as calls to C library's aligned memory allocation routines,
which are platform dependent (<tt class="docutils literal">posix_memalign()</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">free()</tt> on Linux*
and macOS* and <tt class="docutils literal">_aligned_malloc()</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">_aligned_free()</tt> on Windows*). So it's
advised to pair ISPC's <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">delete</tt> with each other, but not with
C/C++ memory management functions.</p>
<p>Note that the rules for <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt> for <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt> are
analogous to the corresponding rules for pointers (as described in
<a class="reference internal" href="#pointer-types">Pointer Types</a>).  Specifically, if a specific rate qualifier isn't
provided with the <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt> expression, then the default is that a &quot;varying&quot;
<tt class="docutils literal">new</tt> is performed, where each program instance performs a unique
allocation.  The allocated type, in turn, is by default <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt>.</p>
<p>After a pointer has been deleted, it is illegal to access the memory it
points to.  However, that deletion happens on a per-program-instance basis.
In other words, consider the following code:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int *ptr = new int[count];
// use ptr
if (count &gt; 1000)
    delete[] ptr;
// ...
</pre>
<p>Here, the program instances where <tt class="docutils literal">count</tt> is greater than 1000 have
deleted the dynamically allocated memory pointed to by <tt class="docutils literal">ptr</tt>, but the
other program instances have not.  As such, it's illegal for the former set
of program instances to access <tt class="docutils literal">*ptr</tt>, but it's perfectly fine for the
latter set to continue to use the memory <tt class="docutils literal">ptr</tt> points to.  Note that it
is illegal to delete a pointer value returned by <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt> more than one
time.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it's useful to be able to do a single allocation for the entire
gang of program instances.  A <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt> statement can be qualified with
<tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> to indicate a single memory allocation:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float * uniform ptr = uniform new float[10];
</pre>
<p>While a regular call to <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt> returns a <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt> pointer (i.e. a
distinct pointer to separately-allocated memory for each program instance),
a <tt class="docutils literal">uniform new</tt> performs a single allocation and returns a <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt>
pointer.  Recall that with a <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt>, the default variability
of the allocated type is <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt>, so the above code is allocating an
array of ten <tt class="docutils literal">varying float</tt> values.</p>
<p>When using <tt class="docutils literal">uniform new</tt>, it's important to be aware of a subtlety; if
the returned pointer is stored in a varying pointer variable (as may be
appropriate and useful for the particular program being written), then the
varying pointer may inadvertently be passed to a subsequent <tt class="docutils literal">delete</tt>
statement, which is an error: effectively</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
varying float * ptr = uniform new float[10];
// use ptr...
delete ptr;  // ERROR: varying pointer is deleted
</pre>
<p>In this case, <tt class="docutils literal">ptr</tt> will be deleted multiple times, once for each
executing program instance, which is an error (unless it happens that only
a single program instance is active in the above code.)</p>
<p>When using <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt> statements, it's important to make an appropriate choice
of <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt>, for both the <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt> operator itself as well
as the type of data being allocated, based on the program's needs.
Consider the following four memory allocations:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform float * uniform p1 = uniform new uniform float[10];
float * uniform p2 = uniform new float[10];
float * p3 = new float[10];
varying float * p4 = new varying float[10];
</pre>
<p>Assuming that a <tt class="docutils literal">float</tt> is 4 bytes in memory and if the gang size is 8
program instances, then the first allocation represents a single allocation
of 10 <tt class="docutils literal">uniform float</tt> values (40 bytes), the second is a single
allocation of 10 <tt class="docutils literal">varying float</tt> values (8*4*10 = 320 bytes), the third
is 8 allocations of 10 <tt class="docutils literal">uniform float</tt> values (8 allocations of 40 bytes
each), and the last performs 8 allocations of 320 bytes each.</p>
<p>Note in particular that varying allocations of varying data types are rarely
desirable in practice.  In that case, each program instance is performing a
separate allocation of <tt class="docutils literal">varying float</tt> memory.  In this case, it's likely
that the program instances will only access a single element of each
<tt class="docutils literal">varying float</tt>, which is wasteful.  (This in turn is partially why the
allocated type is uniform by default with both pointers and <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt>
statements.)</p>
<p>Although <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> doesn't support constructors or destructors like C++, it
is possible to provide initializer values with <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt> statements:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
struct Point { float x, y, z; };
Point *pptr = new Point(10, 20, 30);
</pre>
<p>Here for example, the &quot;x&quot; element of the returned <tt class="docutils literal">Point</tt> is initialized
to have the value 10 and so forth.  In general, the rules for how
initializer values provided in <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt> statements are used to initialize
complex data types follow the same rules as initializers for variables
described in <a class="reference internal" href="#declarations-and-initializers">Declarations and Initializers</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="type-casting">
<h2>Type Casting</h2>
<p>C-style type casting expression works as in C language with an exception that
unbound type is not treated as <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt> by default.</p>
<p>When typecasting to some type <tt class="docutils literal">T</tt> without specifying a variability, the
variability is derived from the type of expression being casted. I.e. the
expression <tt class="docutils literal">(int) E</tt> has the same variability as original expression <tt class="docutils literal">E</tt>.
This feature may lead to confusion when the resulting expression is used
as a function argument. Consider an example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float bar(uniform float f);
float bar(varying float f);
float foo(uniform int B) {

<h2>Basic Iteration Statements: &quot;for&quot;, &quot;while&quot;, and &quot;do&quot;</h2>

<p>Note that all of these looping constructs have the effect of executing
independently for each of the program instances in a gang; for example, if

<div class="section" id="iteration-over-active-program-instances-foreach-active">
<h2>Iteration over active program instances: &quot;foreach_active&quot;</h2>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">foreach_active</tt> construct specifies a loop that serializes over the

<p>As an example of the use of this construct, consider an application where
each program instance independently computes an offset into a shared array
that is being updated:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform float array[...] = { ... };
int index = ...;

could instead be written inside a <tt class="docutils literal">foreach_active</tt> statement:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

    ++array[index];

</pre>
<p>The variable name provided in parenthesis after the <tt class="docutils literal">foreach_active</tt>

of that name to be declared, where the variable takes the <tt class="docutils literal">programIndex</tt>
value of the program instance executing at each loop iteration.</p>
<p>In the code above, because only one program instance is executing at a time
when the loop body executes, the update to <tt class="docutils literal">array</tt> is well-defined.
Note that for this particular example, the &quot;local atomic&quot; operations in

<h2>Iteration over unique elements: &quot;foreach_unique&quot;</h2>
<p>It can be useful to iterate over the elements of a varying variable,
processing the subsets of them that have the same value together.  For
example, consider a varying variable <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> that has the values <tt class="docutils literal">{1, 2, 2,
1, 1, 0, 0, 0}</tt>, where the program is running on a target with a gang size
of 8 program instances.  Here, <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> has three unique values across the
program instances: <tt class="docutils literal">0</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">1</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">2</tt>.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">foreach_unique</tt> looping construct allows us to iterate over these
unique values.  In the code below, the <tt class="docutils literal">foreach_unique</tt> loop body
executes once for each of the three unique values, with execution mask set
to match the program instances where the varying value matches the current
unique value being processed.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int x = ...; // assume {1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0}
foreach_unique (val in x) {
    extern void func(uniform int v);
    func(val);
}
</pre>
<p>In the above, <tt class="docutils literal">func()</tt> will be called three times, once with value 0,
once with value 1, and once with value 2.  When it is called for value 0,
only the last three program instances will be executing, and so forth.  The
order in which the loop executes for the unique values isn't defined.</p>
<p>The varying expression that provides the values to be iterated over is only
evaluated once, and it must be of an atomic type (<tt class="docutils literal">float</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">int</tt>,
etc.), an <tt class="docutils literal">enum</tt> type, or a pointer type.  The iteration variable <tt class="docutils literal">val</tt>
is a variable of <tt class="docutils literal">const uniform</tt> type of the iteration type; it can't be
modified within the loop.  Finally, <tt class="docutils literal">break</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">return</tt> statements are
illegal within the loop body, but <tt class="docutils literal">continue</tt> statements are allowed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="parallel-iteration-statements-foreach-and-foreach-tiled">
<h2>Parallel Iteration Statements: &quot;foreach&quot; and &quot;foreach_tiled&quot;</h2>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">foreach_tiled</tt> constructs specify loops over a
possibly multi-dimensional domain of integer ranges.  Their role goes
beyond &quot;syntactic sugar&quot;; they provide one of the two key ways of
expressing parallel computation in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>.</p>
<p>In general, a <tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">foreach_tiled</tt> statement takes one or more
dimension specifiers separated by commas, where each dimension is specified
by <tt class="docutils literal">identifier = start ... end</tt>, where <tt class="docutils literal">start</tt> is a signed integer
value less than or equal to <tt class="docutils literal">end</tt>, specifying iteration over all integer
values from <tt class="docutils literal">start</tt> up to and including <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">end-1</span></tt>.  An arbitrary number
of iteration dimensions may be specified, with each one spanning a
different range of values.  Within the <tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt> loop, the given
identifiers are available as <tt class="docutils literal">const varying int32</tt> variables.  The
execution mask starts out &quot;all on&quot; at the start of each <tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt> loop
iteration, but may be changed by control flow constructs within the loop.</p>
<p>It is illegal to have a <tt class="docutils literal">break</tt> statement or a <tt class="docutils literal">return</tt> statement
within a <tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt> loop; a compile-time error will be issued in this
case.  (It is legal to have a <tt class="docutils literal">break</tt> in a regular <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> loop that's
nested inside a <tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt> loop.)  <tt class="docutils literal">continue</tt> statements are legal in
<tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt> loops; they have the same effect as in regular <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> loops:
a program instances that executes a <tt class="docutils literal">continue</tt> statement effectively
skips over the rest of the loop body for the current iteration.</p>
<p>It is also currently illegal to have nested <tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt> statements; this
limitation will be removed in a future release of <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>.</p>
<p>As a specific example, consider the following <tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt> statement:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
foreach (j = 0 ... height, i = 0 ... width) {
    // loop body--process data element (i,j)
}
</pre>
<p>It specifies a loop over a 2D domain, where the <tt class="docutils literal">j</tt> variable goes from 0
to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">height-1</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> goes from 0 to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">width-1</span></tt>.  Within the loop, the
variables <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">j</tt> are available and initialized accordingly.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt> loops actually cause the given iteration domain to be
automatically mapped to the program instances in the gang, so that all of
the data can be processed, in gang-sized chunks.  As a specific example,
consider a simple <tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt> loop like the following, on a target where
the gang size is 8:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
foreach (i = 0 ... 16) {
    // perform computation on element i
}
</pre>
<p>One possible valid execution path of this loop would be for the program
counter the step through the statements of this loop just <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">16/8==2</span></tt>
times; the first time through, with the <tt class="docutils literal">varying int32</tt> variable <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt>
having the values (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7) over the program instances, and the
second time through, having the values (8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15), thus
mapping the available program instances to all of the data by the end of
the loop's execution.</p>
<p>In general, however, you shouldn't make any assumptions about the order in
which elements of the iteration domain will be processed by a <tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt>
loop.  For example, the following code exhibits undefined behavior:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform float a[10][100];
foreach (i = 0 ... 10, j = 0 ... 100) {
    if (i == 0)
        a[i][j] = j;
    else
        // Error: can't assume that a[i-1][j] has been set yet
        a[i][j] = a[i-1][j];
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt> statement generally subdivides the iteration domain by
selecting sets of contiguous elements in the inner-most dimension of the
iteration domain.  This decomposition approach generally leads to coherent
memory reads and writes, but may lead to worse control flow coherence than
other decompositions.</p>
<p>Therefore, <tt class="docutils literal">foreach_tiled</tt> decomposes the iteration domain in a way that
tries to map locations in the domain to program instances in a way that is
compact across all of the dimensions.  For example, on a target with an
8-wide gang size, the following <tt class="docutils literal">foreach_tiled</tt> statement might process
the iteration domain in chunks of 2 elements in <tt class="docutils literal">j</tt> and 4 elements in
<tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> each time.  (The trade-offs between these two constructs are
discussed in more detail in the <a class="reference external" href="perfguide.html#improving-control-flow-coherence-with-foreach-tiled">ispc Performance Guide</a>.)</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
foreach_tiled (j = 0 ... height, i = 0 ... width) {
    // loop body--process data element (i,j)
}

<div class="section" id="parallel-iteration-with-programindex-and-programcount">
<h2>Parallel Iteration with &quot;programIndex&quot; and &quot;programCount&quot;</h2>
<p>In addition to <tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">foreach_tiled</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> provides a
lower-level mechanism for mapping SPMD program instances to data to operate
on via the built-in <tt class="docutils literal">programIndex</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">programCount</tt> variables.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">programIndex</tt> gives the index of the SIMD-lane being used for running
each program instance.  (In other words, it's a varying integer value that
has value zero for the first program instance, and so forth.)  The
<tt class="docutils literal">programCount</tt> builtin gives the total number of instances in the gang.
Together, these can be used to uniquely map executing program instances to
input data. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id8" id="id7">[4]</a></p>

<tt class="docutils literal">threadIdx</tt> in CUDA*.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As a specific example, consider an <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> function that needs to perform
some computation on an array of data.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
for (uniform int i = 0; i &lt; count; i += programCount) {
    float d = data[i + programIndex];
    float r = ....
    result[i + programIndex] = r;
}
</pre>
<p>Here, we've written a loop that explicitly loops over the data in chunks of
<tt class="docutils literal">programCount</tt> elements.  In each loop iteration, the running program
instances effectively collude amongst themselves using <tt class="docutils literal">programIndex</tt> to
determine which elements to work on in a way that ensures that all of the
data elements will be processed.  In this particular case, a <tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt>
loop would be preferable, as <tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt> naturally handles the case where
<tt class="docutils literal">programCount</tt> doesn't evenly divide the number of elements to be
processed, while the loop above assumes that case implicitly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="unstructured-control-flow-goto">
<h2>Unstructured Control Flow: &quot;goto&quot;</h2>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">goto</tt> statements are allowed in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> programs under limited
circumstances; specifically, only when the compiler can determine that if
any program instance executes a <tt class="docutils literal">goto</tt> statement, then all of the program
instances will be running at that statement, such that all will follow the
<tt class="docutils literal">goto</tt>.</p>
<p>Put another way: it's illegal for there to be &quot;varying&quot; control flow
statements in scopes that enclose a <tt class="docutils literal">goto</tt> statement.  An error is issued
if a <tt class="docutils literal">goto</tt> is used in this situation.</p>
<p>The syntax for adding labels to <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> programs and jumping to them with

<h2>&quot;Coherent&quot; Control Flow Statements: &quot;cif&quot; and Friends</h2>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> provides variants of all of the standard control flow constructs
that allow you to supply a hint that control flow is expected to be
coherent at a particular point in the program's execution.  These
mechanisms provide the compiler a hint that it's worth emitting extra code
to check to see if the control flow is in fact coherent at run-time, in
which case a simpler code path can often be executed.</p>
<p>The first of these statements is <tt class="docutils literal">cif</tt>, indicating an <tt class="docutils literal">if</tt> statement

</div>
<div class="section" id="functions-and-function-calls">
<h2>Functions and Function Calls</h2>
<p>Like C, functions must be declared in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> before they are called,
though a forward declaration can be used before the actual function
definition.  Also like C, arrays are passed to functions by reference.
Recursive function calls are legal:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    if (a == 0)
        return b;
    else
        return gcd(b%a, a);
}
</pre>
<p>Functions can be declared with a number of qualifiers that affect their
visibility and capabilities.  As in C/C++, functions have global visibility
by default.  If a function is declared with a <tt class="docutils literal">static</tt> qualifier, then it
is only visible in the file in which it was declared.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
static float lerp(float t, float a, float b) {
    return (1.-t)*a + t*b;
}
</pre>
<p>Any function that can be launched with the <tt class="docutils literal">launch</tt> construct in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>
must have a <tt class="docutils literal">task</tt> qualifier; see <a class="reference internal" href="#task-parallelism-launch-and-sync-statements">Task Parallelism: &quot;launch&quot; and &quot;sync&quot;
Statements</a> for more discussion of launching tasks in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>.</p>
<p>A function can also be given the <tt class="docutils literal">unmasked</tt> qualifier; this qualifier
indicates that all program instances should be made active at the start of
the function execution (or, equivalently, that the current execution mask
shouldn't be passed to the function from the function call site.)  If it is
known that a function will always be called when all program instances are
executing, adding this qualifier can slightly improve performance.  See the
Section <a class="reference internal" href="#re-establishing-the-execution-mask">Re-establishing The Execution Mask</a> for more discussion of
<tt class="docutils literal">unmasked</tt> program code.</p>
<p>Functions that are intended to be called from C/C++ application code must
have the <tt class="docutils literal">export</tt> qualifier.  This causes them to have regular C linkage
and to have their declarations included in header files, if the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>
compiler is directed to generated a C/C++ header file for the file it
compiled.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
export uniform float inc(uniform float v) {
    return v+1;
}
</pre>
<p>Finally, any function defined with an <tt class="docutils literal">inline</tt> qualifier will always be
inlined by <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>; <tt class="docutils literal">inline</tt> is not a hint, but forces inlining.  The
compiler will opportunistically inline short functions depending on their
complexity, but any function that should always be inlined should have the
<tt class="docutils literal">inline</tt> qualifier. Similarly, any function defined with a <tt class="docutils literal">noinline</tt>
qualifier will never be inlined by <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>. <tt class="docutils literal">noinline</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">inline</tt>
cannot be used on the same function.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="function-overloading">
<h2>Function Overloading</h2>
<p>Functions can be overloaded by parameter type.  Given multiple definitions
of a function, <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> uses the following model to choose the best function:
each conversion of two types has its cost. <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> tries to find conversion
with the smallest cost. When <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> can't find any conversion it means that
this function is not suitable. Then <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> sums costs for all arguments and
chooses the function with the smallest final cost. If the chosen function
has some arguments which costs are bigger than their costs in other function
this treats as ambiguous.
Costs of type conversions placed from small to big:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Parameter types match exactly.</li>
<li>Function parameter type is reference and parameters match when any reference-type parameter are considered equivalent to their underlying type.</li>
<li>Function parameter type is const-reference and parameters match when any reference-type parameter are considered equivalent to their underlying type ignoring const attributes.</li>
<li>Parameters match exactly, except constant attributes. [NO CONSTANT ATTRIBUTES LATER]</li>
<li>Parameters match exactly, except reference attributes. [NO REFERENCES ATTRIBUTES LATER]</li>
<li>Parameters match with only type conversions that don't risk losing any information (for example, converting an int16 value to an int32 parameter value.)</li>
<li>Parameters match with only promotions from uniform to varying types.</li>
<li>Parameters match using arbitrary type conversion, without changing variability from uniform to varying (e.g., int to float, float to int.)</li>
<li>Parameters match with widening and promotions from uniform to varying types. (combination of &quot;6&quot; and &quot;7&quot;)</li>
<li>Parameters match using arbitrary type conversion, including also changing variability from uniform to varying.</li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If function parameter type is reference and neither &quot;2&quot; nor &quot;3&quot; aren't suitable, function is not suitable</li>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="re-establishing-the-execution-mask">
<h2>Re-establishing The Execution Mask</h2>
<p>As discussed in <a class="reference internal" href="#functions-and-function-calls">Functions and Function Calls</a>, a function that is
declared with an <tt class="docutils literal">unmasked</tt> qualifier starts execution with all program
instances running, regardless of the execution mask at the site of the
function call.  A block of statements can also be enclosed with
<tt class="docutils literal">unmasked</tt> to have the same effect within a function:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int a = ..., b = ...;
if (a &lt; b) {
    // only program instances where a &lt; b are executing here
    unmasked {
        // now all program instances are executing
    }
    // and again only the a &lt; b instances
}
</pre>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">unmasked</tt> can be useful in cases where the programmer wants to &quot;change
the axis of parallelism&quot; or use nested parallelism, as shown in the
following code:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform WorkItem items[...] = ...;
foreach (itemNum = 0 ... numItems) {
    // do computation on items[itemNum] to determine if it needs
    // further processing...
    if (/* itemNum needs processing */) {
        foreach_active (i) {
            unmasked {
                uniform int uItemNum = extract(itemNum, i);
                // apply entire gang of program instances to uItemNum
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The general idea is that we are first using SPMD parallelism to determine
which of the items requires further processing, checking a gang's worth of
them concurrently inside the <tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt> loop.  Assuming that only a subset
of them needs further processing, would be wasteful to do this work within
the <tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt> loop in the same program instance that made the initial
determination of whether more work as needed; in this case, all of the
program instances corresponding to items that didn't need further
processing would be inactive, with corresponding unused computational
capability in the system.</p>
<p>In the above code, this issue is avoided by working on each of the items
requiring more processing in turn with <tt class="docutils literal">foreach_active</tt> and then using
<tt class="docutils literal">unmasked</tt> to re-establish execution of all of the program instances.
The entire gang can in turn be applied to the computation to be done for
each <tt class="docutils literal">items[itemNum]</tt>.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">unmasked</tt> statement should be used with care; it can lead to a
number of surprising cases of undefined program behavior.  For example,
consider the following code:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
void func(float);
float a = ...;
float b;
if (a &lt; 0) {
    b = 0;
    unmasked {
        if (b == 0)
            func(a);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The variable <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> is initialized to some value and <tt class="docutils literal">b</tt> is declared but
not initialized, and thus has an undefined value.  Within the <tt class="docutils literal">if</tt> test,
we have assigned zero to <tt class="docutils literal">b</tt>, though only for the program instances
currently executing--i.e. those where <tt class="docutils literal">a &lt; 0</tt>.  After re-establishing the
executing mask with <tt class="docutils literal">unmasked</tt>, we then compare <tt class="docutils literal">b</tt> to zero--this
comparison is well-defined (and &quot;true&quot;) for the program instances where <tt class="docutils literal">a
&lt; 0</tt>, but it is undefined for any program instances where that isn't the
case, since the value of <tt class="docutils literal">b</tt> is undefined for those program instances.
Similar surprising cases can arise when writing to <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt> variables
within <tt class="docutils literal">unmasked</tt> code.</p>
<p>As a general rule, code within an <tt class="docutils literal">unmasked</tt> block, or a function with
the <tt class="docutils literal">unmasked</tt> qualifier should use great care when accessing <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt>
variables that were declared in an outer scope.</p>

<div class="section" id="task-parallel-execution">
<h2>Task Parallel Execution</h2>
<p>In addition to the facilities for using SPMD for parallelism across the
SIMD lanes of one processing core, <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> also provides facilities for
parallel execution across multiple cores though an asynchronous function
call mechanism via the <tt class="docutils literal">launch</tt> keyword.  A function called with
<tt class="docutils literal">launch</tt> executes as an asynchronous task, often on another core in the
system.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="task-parallelism-launch-and-sync-statements">
<h2>Task Parallelism: &quot;launch&quot; and &quot;sync&quot; Statements</h2>
<p>One option for combining task-parallelism with <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> is to just use
regular task parallelism in the C/C++ application code (be it through
Intel® Thread Building Blocks, OpenMP or another task system), and
for tasks to use <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> for SPMD parallelism across the vector lanes as
appropriate.  Alternatively, <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> also has support for launching tasks
from <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> code.  (Check the <tt class="docutils literal">examples/mandelbrot_tasks</tt> example to
see how it is used.)</p>
<p>Any function that is launched as a task must be declared with the
<tt class="docutils literal">task</tt> qualifier:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
task void func(uniform float a[], uniform int index) {
    ...
    a[index] = ....
}
</pre>
<p>Tasks must return <tt class="docutils literal">void</tt>; a compile time error is issued if a
non-<tt class="docutils literal">void</tt> task is defined.</p>
<p>Given a task declaration, a task can be launched with <tt class="docutils literal">launch</tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform float a[...] = ...;
launch func(a, 1);
</pre>
<p>Program execution continues asynchronously after a <tt class="docutils literal">launch</tt> statement in
a function; thus, a function shouldn't access values written by a task it
has launched within the function without synchronization.  A function can
use a <tt class="docutils literal">sync</tt> statement to wait for all launched tasks to finish:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
launch func(a, 1);
sync;
// now safe to use computed values in a[]...
</pre>
<p>Alternatively, any function that launches tasks has an automatically-added
implicit <tt class="docutils literal">sync</tt> statement before it returns, so that functions that call
a function that launches tasks don't have to worry about outstanding
asynchronous computation from that function.</p>
<p>The task generated by a <tt class="docutils literal">launch</tt> statement is a single gang's worth of
work.  The same program instances are respectively active and inactive at
the start of the task as were active and inactive when their <tt class="docutils literal">launch</tt>
statement executed.  To make all program instances in the launched gang be
active, the <tt class="docutils literal">unmasked</tt> construct can be used (see <a class="reference internal" href="#re-establishing-the-execution-mask">Re-establishing The
Execution Mask</a>.)</p>
<p>There are two ways to write code that launches a group multiple tasks.
First, one task can be launched at a time, with parameters passed to the
task to help it determine what part of the overall computation it's
responsible for:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
for (uniform int i = 0; i &lt; 100; ++i)
    launch func(a, i);

<p>This code launches 100 tasks, each of which presumably does some
computation that is keyed off of given the value <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt>.  In general, one
should launch many more tasks than there are processors in the system to
ensure good load-balancing, but not so many that the overhead of scheduling
and running tasks dominates the computation.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a number of tasks may be launched from a single <tt class="docutils literal">launch</tt>
statement.  We might instead write the above example with a single
<tt class="docutils literal">launch</tt> like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
launch[100] func2(a);
</pre>
<p>Where an integer value (not necessarily a compile-time constant) is
provided to the <tt class="docutils literal">launch</tt> keyword in square brackets; this number of tasks
will be enqueued to be run asynchronously.  Within each of the tasks, two
special built-in variables are available--<tt class="docutils literal">taskIndex</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">taskCount</tt>.
The first, <tt class="docutils literal">taskIndex</tt>, ranges from zero to one minus the number of tasks
provided to <tt class="docutils literal">launch</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">taskCount</tt> equals the number of launched
tasks.  Thus, in this example we might use <tt class="docutils literal">taskIndex</tt> in the
implementation of <tt class="docutils literal">func2</tt> to determine which array element to process.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
task void func2(uniform float a[]) {
    ...
    a[taskIndex] = ...
}
</pre>
<p>Inside functions with the <tt class="docutils literal">task</tt> qualifier, two additional built-in
variables are provided in addition to <tt class="docutils literal">taskIndex</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">taskCount</tt>:
<tt class="docutils literal">threadIndex</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">threadCount</tt>.  <tt class="docutils literal">threadCount</tt> gives the total
number of hardware threads that have been launched by the task system.
<tt class="docutils literal">threadIndex</tt> provides an index between zero and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">threadCount-1</span></tt> that
gives a unique index that corresponds to the hardware thread that is
executing the current task.  The <tt class="docutils literal">threadIndex</tt> can be used for accessing
data that is private to the current thread and thus doesn't require
synchronization to access under parallel execution.</p>
<p>The tasking system also supports multi-dimensional partitioning (currently up
to three dimensions). To launch a 3D grid of tasks, for example with <tt class="docutils literal">N0</tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal">N1</tt>  and <tt class="docutils literal">N2</tt> tasks in x-, y- and z-dimension respectively</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float data[N2][N1][N0]
task void foo_task()
{
   data[taskIndex2][taskIndex1][threadIndex0] = taskIndex;
}
</pre>
<p>we use the following <tt class="docutils literal">launch</tt> expressions:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
launch [N2][N1][N0] foo_task()
</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
launch [N0,N1,N2] foo_task()
</pre>
<p>Value of <tt class="docutils literal">taskIndex</tt> is equal to <tt class="docutils literal">taskIndex0 + <span class="pre">taskCount0*(taskIndex1</span> +
taskCount1*taskIndex2)</tt> and it ranges from <tt class="docutils literal">0</tt> to  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">taskCount-1</span></tt>, where
<tt class="docutils literal">taskCount = taskCount0*taskCount1*taskCount2</tt>. If <tt class="docutils literal">N1</tt> or/and <tt class="docutils literal">N2</tt> are
not specified in the <tt class="docutils literal">launch</tt> expression, a value of <tt class="docutils literal">1</tt> is assumed.
Finally, for an one-dimensional grid of tasks,  <tt class="docutils literal">taskIndex</tt> is equivalent to
<tt class="docutils literal">taskIndex0</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">taskCount</tt> is equivalent to <tt class="docutils literal">taskCount0</tt>.</p>

<div class="section" id="task-parallelism-runtime-requirements">
<h2>Task Parallelism: Runtime Requirements</h2>
<p>If you use the task launch feature in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>, you must provide C/C++
implementations of three specific functions that manage launching and
synchronizing parallel tasks; these functions must be linked into your
executable.  Although these functions may be implemented in any
language, they must have &quot;C&quot; linkage (i.e. their prototypes must be
declared inside an <tt class="docutils literal">extern &quot;C&quot;</tt> block if they are defined in C++.)</p>
<p>By using user-supplied versions of these functions, <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> programs can
easily interoperate with software systems that have existing task systems
for managing parallelism.  If you're using <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> with a system that
isn't otherwise multi-threaded and don't want to write custom
implementations of them, you can use the implementations of these functions
provided in the <tt class="docutils literal">examples/common/tasksys.cpp</tt> file in the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>
distributions.</p>
<p>If you are implementing your own task system, the remainder of this section
discusses the requirements for these calls.  You will also likely want to
review the example task systems in <tt class="docutils literal">examples/common/tasksys.cpp</tt> for reference.
If you are not implementing your own task system, you can skip reading the
remainder of this section.</p>
<p>Here are the declarations of the three functions that must be provided to
manage tasks in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
void *ISPCAlloc(void **handlePtr, int64_t size, int32_t alignment);
void ISPCLaunch(void **handlePtr, void *f, void *data, int count0, int count1, int count2);
void ISPCSync(void *handle);
</pre>
<p>All three of these functions take an opaque handle (or a pointer to an
opaque handle) as their first parameter.  This handle allows the task
system runtime to distinguish between calls to these functions from
different functions in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> code.  In this way, the task system
implementation can efficiently wait for completion on just the tasks
launched from a single function.</p>
<p>The first time one of <tt class="docutils literal">ISPCLaunch()</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">ISPCAlloc()</tt> is called in an
<tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> function, the <tt class="docutils literal">void *</tt> pointed to by the <tt class="docutils literal">handlePtr</tt> parameter
will be <tt class="docutils literal">NULL</tt>.  The implementations of these function should then
initialize <tt class="docutils literal">*handlePtr</tt> to a unique handle value of some sort.  (For
example, it might allocate a small structure to record which tasks were
launched by the current function.)  In subsequent calls to these functions
in the emitted <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> code, the same value for <tt class="docutils literal">handlePtr</tt> will be
passed in, such that loading from <tt class="docutils literal">*handlePtr</tt> will retrieve the value
stored in the first call.</p>
<p>At function exit (or at an explicit <tt class="docutils literal">sync</tt> statement), a call to
<tt class="docutils literal">ISPCSync()</tt> will be generated if <tt class="docutils literal">*handlePtr</tt> is non-<tt class="docutils literal">NULL</tt>.
Therefore, the handle value is passed directly to <tt class="docutils literal">ISPCSync()</tt>, rather
than a pointer to it, as in the other functions.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">ISPCAlloc()</tt> function is used to allocate small blocks of memory to
store parameters passed to tasks.  It should return a pointer to memory
with the given size and alignment.  Note that there is no explicit
<tt class="docutils literal">ISPCFree()</tt> call; instead, all memory allocated within an <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>
function should be freed when <tt class="docutils literal">ISPCSync()</tt> is called.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">ISPCLaunch()</tt> is called to launch one or more asynchronous
tasks.  Each <tt class="docutils literal">launch</tt> statement in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> code causes a call to
<tt class="docutils literal">ISPCLaunch()</tt> to be emitted in the generated code.  The three parameters
after the handle pointer to the function are relatively straightforward;
the <tt class="docutils literal">void *f</tt> parameter holds a pointer to a function to call to run the
work for this task, <tt class="docutils literal">data</tt> holds a pointer to data to pass to this
function, and <tt class="docutils literal">count0</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">count1</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">count2</tt> are the number of instances
of this function to enqueue for asynchronous execution.  (In other words,
<tt class="docutils literal">count0</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">count1</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">count2</tt> correspond to the value <tt class="docutils literal">n0</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">n1</tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal">n2</tt> in a multiple-task launch statement like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">launch[n2][n1][n0]</span></tt> or
<tt class="docutils literal">launch [n0,n1,n2]</tt> respectively.)</p>
<p>The signature of the provided function pointer <tt class="docutils literal">f</tt> is</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
void (*TaskFuncPtr)(void *data, int threadIndex, int threadCount,
                    int taskIndex, int taskCount,
                    int taskIndex0, int taskIndex1, int taskIndex2,
                    int taskCount0, int taskCount1, int taskCount2);
</pre>
<p>When this function pointer is called by one of the hardware threads managed
by the task system, the <tt class="docutils literal">data</tt> pointer passed to <tt class="docutils literal">ISPCLaunch()</tt> should
be passed to it for its first parameter; <tt class="docutils literal">threadCount</tt> gives the total
number of hardware threads that have been spawned to run tasks and
<tt class="docutils literal">threadIndex</tt> should be an integer index between zero and <tt class="docutils literal">threadCount</tt>
uniquely identifying the hardware thread that is running the task.  (These
values can be used to index into thread-local storage.)</p>
<p>The value of <tt class="docutils literal">taskCount</tt> should be the total number of tasks launched in the
<tt class="docutils literal">launch</tt> statement (it must be equal to <tt class="docutils literal">taskCount0*taskCount1*taskCount2</tt>)
that caused the call to <tt class="docutils literal">ISPCLaunch()</tt> and each of the calls to this function
should be given a unique value of <tt class="docutils literal">taskIndex</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">taskIndex0</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">taskIndex1</tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal">taskIndex2</tt> between zero and <tt class="docutils literal">taskCount</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">taskCount0</tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal">taskCount1</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">taskCount2</tt> respectively,  with <tt class="docutils literal">taskIndex = taskIndex0
+ <span class="pre">taskCount0*(taskIndex1</span> + taskCount1*taskIndex2)</tt>, to distinguish which of
the instances of the set of launched tasks is running.</p>

<div class="section" id="llvm-intrinsic-functions">
<h2>LLVM Intrinsic Functions</h2>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> has an experimental feature to call LLVM intrinsics directly from
<tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> source code.  It's strongly discouraged to use this feature in production
code, unless the consequences are well understood.  Specifically:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Availability and naming of LLVM intrinsics depend on the specific LLVM
version used for <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> build and may change without notice.</li>
<li>Only basic verification of availability of target-specific intrinsics
on the target CPU is performed. The attempt of using not supported
intrinsics may lead to compiler crash.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using LLVM intrinsics is encouraged for experiments and may be useful in the
following cases:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> fails to generate specific instruction, which is necessary
for better performance.</li>
<li>If there's no higher level primitives (in standard library or language itself)
for some of instructions. For example, this might be the case with new
ISA extensions.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you found the case where the use of LLVM intrinsics is beneficial in your code,
please let us know by opening an issue in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ispc/ispc/issues?state=open">bug tracker</a>.</p>
<p>To use this feature, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--enable-llvm-intrinsics</span></tt> switch must be passed to <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>.
The syntax is similar to a normal function call, but the name must start with <tt class="docutils literal">&#64;</tt> symbol.
For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
transpose = &#64;llvm.matrix.transpose.v8f32.i32.i32(matrix, row, column);
</pre>
<p>To detect if this feature is enabled during compile time, check if <tt class="docutils literal">ISPC_LLVM_INTRINSICS_ENABLED</tt>
macro is defined.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="the-ispc-standard-library">
<h1>The ISPC Standard Library</h1>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> has a standard library that is automatically available when
compiling <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> programs.  (To disable the standard library, pass the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--nostdlib</span></tt> command-line flag to the compiler.)</p>
<div class="section" id="basic-operations-on-data">
<h2>Basic Operations On Data</h2>
</div>
<div class="section" id="logical-and-selection-operations">
<h2>Logical and Selection Operations</h2>
<p>Recall from <a class="reference internal" href="#expressions">Expressions</a> that <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> short-circuits the evaluation of
logical and selection operators: given an expression like <tt class="docutils literal">(index &lt; count
&amp;&amp; array[index] == 0)</tt>, then <tt class="docutils literal">array[index] == 0</tt> is only evaluated if
<tt class="docutils literal">index &lt; count</tt> is true.  This property is useful for writing expressions
like the preceding one, where the second expression may not be safe to
evaluate in some cases.</p>
<p>This short-circuiting can impose overhead in the generated code; additional
operations are required to test the first value and to conditionally jump
over the code that evaluates the second value.  The <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> compiler does
try to mitigate this cost by detecting cases where it is both safe and
inexpensive to evaluate both expressions, and skips short-circuiting in the
generated code in this case (without there being any programmer-visible
change in program behavior.)</p>
<p>For cases where the compiler can't detect this case but the programmer
wants to avoid short-circuiting behavior, the standard library provides a
few helper functions.  First, <tt class="docutils literal">and()</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">or()</tt> provide
non-short-circuiting logical AND and OR operations.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
bool and(bool a, bool b)
bool or(bool a, bool b)
uniform bool and(uniform bool a, uniform bool b)
uniform bool or(uniform bool a, uniform bool b)
</pre>
<p>And there are three variants of <tt class="docutils literal">select()</tt> that select between two values
based on a boolean condition.  If condition <tt class="docutils literal">cond</tt> is true, <tt class="docutils literal">t</tt> is selected,
otherwise <tt class="docutils literal">f</tt>. These are the variants of <tt class="docutils literal">select()</tt> for the <tt class="docutils literal">int8</tt> type:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int8 select(bool cond, int8 t, int8 f)
int8 select(uniform bool cond, int8 t, int8 f)
uniform int8 select(uniform bool cond, uniform int8 t, uniform int8 f)
</pre>
<p>There are also variants for <tt class="docutils literal">int16</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">int32</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">int64</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">float</tt>, and
<tt class="docutils literal">double</tt> types.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bit-operations">
<h2>Bit Operations</h2>
<p>The various variants of <tt class="docutils literal">popcnt()</tt> return the population count--the
number of bits set in the given value.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform int popcnt(uniform int v)
int popcnt(int v)
uniform int popcnt(bool v)
</pre>
<p>A few functions determine how many leading bits in the given value are zero
and how many of the trailing bits are zero; there are also <tt class="docutils literal">unsigned</tt>
variants of these functions and variants that take <tt class="docutils literal">int64</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">unsigned
int64</tt> types.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int32 count_leading_zeros(int32 v)
uniform int32 count_leading_zeros(uniform int32 v)
int32 count_trailing_zeros(int32 v)
uniform int32 count_trailing_zeros(uniform int32 v)
</pre>
<p>Sometimes it's useful to convert a <tt class="docutils literal">bool</tt> value to an integer using sign
extension so that the integer's bits are all on if the <tt class="docutils literal">bool</tt> has the
value <tt class="docutils literal">true</tt> (rather than just having the value one).  The
<tt class="docutils literal">sign_extend()</tt> functions provide this functionality:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int sign_extend(bool value)
uniform int sign_extend(uniform bool value)
</pre>
<p>Also it is possible to convert a <tt class="docutils literal">bool</tt> varying value to an integer using
<tt class="docutils literal">packmask</tt> function.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform int packmask(bool value)
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">intbits()</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">floatbits()</tt> functions can be used to implement
low-level floating-point bit twiddling.  For example, <tt class="docutils literal">intbits()</tt> returns
an <tt class="docutils literal">unsigned int</tt> that is a bit-for-bit copy of the given <tt class="docutils literal">float</tt>
value.  (Note: it is <strong>not</strong> the same as <tt class="docutils literal">(int)a</tt>, but corresponds to
something like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*((int</span> <span class="pre">*)&amp;a)</span></tt> in C.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float floatbits(unsigned int a);
uniform float floatbits(uniform unsigned int a);
unsigned int intbits(float a);
uniform unsigned int intbits(uniform float a);
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">intbits()</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">floatbits()</tt> functions have no cost at runtime;
they just let the compiler know how to interpret the bits of the given
value.  They make it possible to efficiently write functions that take
advantage of the low-level bit representation of floating-point values.</p>
<p>For example, the <tt class="docutils literal">abs()</tt> function in the standard library is implemented
as follows:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float abs(float a) {
    unsigned int i = intbits(a);
    i &amp;= 0x7fffffff;
    return floatbits(i);
}
</pre>
<p>This code directly clears the high order bit to ensure that the given
floating-point value is positive.  This compiles down to a single <tt class="docutils literal">andps</tt>
instruction when used with an Intel® SSE target, for example.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="math-functions">
<h2>Math Functions</h2>

<p>A number of different implementations of the transcendental math functions

<p><tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> provides a standard variety of calls for trigonometric functions:</p>

<p>If both sine and cosine are needed, then the <tt class="docutils literal">sincos()</tt> call computes
both more efficiently than two calls to the respective individual
functions:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

<p>A few functions that end up doing low-level manipulation of the
floating-point representation in memory are available.  As in the standard
math library, <tt class="docutils literal">ldexp()</tt> multiplies the value <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> by 2^n, and

values as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pseudo-random-numbers">
<h2>Pseudo-Random Numbers</h2>
<p>A simple random number generator is provided by the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> standard
library.  State for the RNG is maintained in an instance of the
<tt class="docutils literal">RNGState</tt> structure, which is seeded with <tt class="docutils literal">seed_rng()</tt>.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
struct RNGState;
void seed_rng(varying RNGState * uniform state, varying int seed)
void seed_rng(uniform RNGState * uniform state, uniform int seed)
</pre>
<p>Note that if the same <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt> seed value is used for all of the program
instances (e.g. <tt class="docutils literal">RNGState state; <span class="pre">seed_rng(&amp;state,</span> 1);</tt>), then all of the
program instances in the gang will see the same sequence of pseudo-random
numbers.  If this behavior isn't desred, you may want to add the
<tt class="docutils literal">programIndex</tt> value to the provided seed or otherwise ensure that the
seed has a unique value for each program instance.</p>
<p>After the RNG is seeded, the <tt class="docutils literal">random()</tt> function can be used to get a
pseudo-random <tt class="docutils literal">unsigned int32</tt> value and the <tt class="docutils literal">frandom()</tt> function can

<h2>Random Numbers</h2>
<p>Some recent CPUs (including those based on the Intel® Ivy Bridge
micro-architecture), provide support for generating true random numbers.  A
few standard library functions make this functionality available:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
bool rdrand(uniform int32 * uniform ptr)
bool rdrand(varying int32 * uniform ptr)
bool rdrand(uniform int32 * varying ptr)
</pre>
<p>If the processor doesn't have sufficient entropy to generate a random
number, then this function fails and returns <tt class="docutils literal">false</tt>.  Otherwise, if the
processor is successful, the random value is stored in the given pointer
and <tt class="docutils literal">true</tt> is returned.  Therefore, this function should generally be
used as follows, called repeatedly until it is successful:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int r;
while (rdrand(&amp;r) == false)
    ; // empty loop body
</pre>
<p>In addition to the <tt class="docutils literal">int32</tt> variants of <tt class="docutils literal">rdrand()</tt> listed above, there
are versions that return <tt class="docutils literal">int16</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">float</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">int64</tt> values as
well.</p>
<p>Note that when compiling to targets older than <tt class="docutils literal">avx2</tt>, the
<tt class="docutils literal">rdrand()</tt> functions always return <tt class="docutils literal">false</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="output-functions">
<h2>Output Functions</h2>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> has a simple <tt class="docutils literal">print</tt> statement for printing values during
program execution.  In the following short <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> program, there are
three uses of the <tt class="docutils literal">print</tt> statement:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
export void foo(uniform float f[4], uniform int i) {
    float x = f[programIndex];
    print(&quot;i = %, x = %\n&quot;, i, x);
    if (x &lt; 2) {
        ++x;
        print(&quot;added to x = %\n&quot;, x);
    }
    print(&quot;last print of x = %\n&quot;, x);
}
</pre>
<p>There are a few things to note.  First, the function is called <tt class="docutils literal">print</tt>,
not <tt class="docutils literal">printf</tt> (unlike C).  Second, the formatting string passed to this
function only uses a single percent sign to denote where the corresponding
value should be printed.  You don't need to match the types of formatting
operators with the types being passed.  However, you can't currently use
the rich data formatting options that <tt class="docutils literal">printf</tt> provides (e.g. constructs
like <tt class="docutils literal">%.10f</tt>.).</p>
<p>If this function is called with the array of floats (0,1,2,3) passed in for
the <tt class="docutils literal">f</tt> parameter and the value <tt class="docutils literal">10</tt> for the <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> parameter, it
generates the following output on a four-wide compilation target:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
i = 10, x = [0.000000,1.000000,2.000000,3.000000]
added to x = [1.000000,2.000000,((2.000000)),((3.000000))]
last print of x = [1.000000,2.000000,2.000000,3.000000]
</pre>
<p>When a varying variable is printed, the values for program instances that
aren't currently executing are printed inside double parenthesis,
indicating inactive program instances.  The elements for inactive program
instances may have garbage values, though in some circumstances it can be
useful to see their values.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="assertions">
<h2>Assertions</h2>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> standard library includes a mechanism for adding <tt class="docutils literal">assert()</tt>
statements to <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> program code.  Like <tt class="docutils literal">assert()</tt> in C, the
<tt class="docutils literal">assert()</tt> function takes a single boolean expression as an argument.  If
the expression evaluates to false at runtime, then a diagnostic error
message printed and the <tt class="docutils literal">abort()</tt> function is called.</p>
<p>When called with a <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt> quantity, an assertion triggers if the
expression evaluates to false for any of the executing program instances
at the point where it is called.  Thus, given code like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int x = programIndex - 2;  // (-2, -1, 0, ... )
if (x &gt; 0)
    assert(x &gt; 0);
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">assert()</tt> statement will not trigger, since the condition isn't true
for any of the executing program instances at that point.  (If this
<tt class="docutils literal">assert()</tt> statement was outside of this <tt class="docutils literal">if</tt>, then it would of course
trigger.)</p>
<p>To disable all of the assertions in a file that is being compiled (e.g.,
for an optimized release build), use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--opt=disable-assertions</span></tt>
command-line argument.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="compiler-optimization-hints">
<h2>Compiler Optimization Hints</h2>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> standard library includes a mechanism for adding <tt class="docutils literal">assume()</tt>
statements to <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> program code. The <tt class="docutils literal">assume()</tt> function takes a
single uniform boolean expression as an argument. This expression is
assumed to be <tt class="docutils literal">true</tt> and this information will be used for optimization
when possible. This feature is currently only available on CPU targets.</p>
<p>The condition used in <tt class="docutils literal">assume()</tt> statement will not be code generated and
does not imply runtime checks. It will solely be used as optimization hint,
if compiler is able to use this information.</p>
<p>Below are some basic examples of this functionality.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
inline uniform int bar1(uniform int a, uniform int b) {
    if (a &lt; b)
        return 2;
    return 5;
}
uniform int foo1(uniform int a, uniform int b) {
    assume(a &lt; b);
    return bar1(a, b);
}
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">assume()</tt> hint allows the compiler to resolve <tt class="docutils literal">a &lt; b</tt> during compile
time in <tt class="docutils literal">bar1()</tt> and return <tt class="docutils literal">2</tt> thus removing the additional branch.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
inline void bar2(uniform int * uniform a) {
    if (a != NULL) {
        a[2] = 9;
    }
 }
 void foo2(uniform int a[]) {
    assume(a != NULL);
    bar2(a);
 }
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">assume()</tt> hint allows the compiler to remove <tt class="docutils literal">a != NULL</tt> during compile
time in <tt class="docutils literal">bar2()</tt> thus removing the additional check.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int foo3(uniform int a[], uniform int count) {
    int ret = 0;
    assume(count % programCount == 0);
    foreach (i = 0 ... count) {
        ret += a[i];
    }
    return ret;
}
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">assume()</tt> hint informs the compiler <tt class="docutils literal">count</tt> is a multiple of
<tt class="docutils literal">programCount</tt> during compile time. This results in removal of remainder
loop usually required for <tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt>.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
typedef float&lt;TARGET_WIDTH&gt; AlignedFloat;
unmasked void foo4(uniform float Result[], const uniform float Source1[], const uniform unsigned int Iterations)
{
     assume(((uniform uint64)((void*)Source1) &amp; (32 * TARGET_WIDTH)-1) == 0);
     assume(((uniform uint64)((void*)Result) &amp; (32 * TARGET_WIDTH)-1) == 0);
     uniform AlignedFloat S1;
     S1[programIndex] = Source1[programIndex];
     const uniform AlignedFloat R = S1;
     Result[programIndex] = R[programIndex];
}
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">assume()</tt> hint informs the compiler that memory locations used by
loads and stores are aligned. This results in aligned instructions instead
of unaligned instructions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cross-program-instance-operations">
<h2>Cross-Program Instance Operations</h2>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> programs are often used to express independently-executing
programs performing computation on separate data elements.  (i.e. pure
data-parallelism).  However, it's often the case where it's useful for the
program instances to be able to cooperate in computing results.  The
cross-lane operations described in this section provide primitives for
communication between the running program instances in the gang.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">lanemask()</tt> function returns an integer that encodes which of the
current SPMD program instances are currently executing.  The i'th bit is
set if the i'th program instance lane is currently active.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform int lanemask()
</pre>
<p>To broadcast a value from one program instance to all of the others, a
<tt class="docutils literal">broadcast()</tt> function is available.  It broadcasts the value of the
<tt class="docutils literal">value</tt> parameter for the program instance given by <tt class="docutils literal">index</tt> to all of
the running program instances.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int8 broadcast(int8 value, uniform int index)
int16 broadcast(int16 value, uniform int index)
int32 broadcast(int32 value, uniform int index)
int64 broadcast(int64 value, uniform int index)
float broadcast(float value, uniform int index)
double broadcast(double value, uniform int index)
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">rotate()</tt> function allows each program instance to find the value of
the given value that their neighbor <tt class="docutils literal">offset</tt> steps away has.  For
example, on an 8-wide target, if <tt class="docutils literal">value</tt> has the value (1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8) across the gang of running program instances, then <tt class="docutils literal">rotate(value,
<span class="pre">-1)</span></tt> causes the first program instance to get the value 8, the second
program instance to get the value 1, the third 2, and so forth.  The
provided offset value can be positive or negative, and may be greater than
the size of the gang (it is masked to ensure valid offsets).</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int8 rotate(int8 value, uniform int offset)
int16 rotate(int16 value, uniform int offset)
int32 rotate(int32 value, uniform int offset)
int64 rotate(int64 value, uniform int offset)
float rotate(float value, uniform int offset)
double rotate(double value, uniform int offset)
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">shift()</tt> function allows each program instance to find the value of
the given value that their neighbor <tt class="docutils literal">offset</tt> steps away has.  This is similar
to <tt class="docutils literal">rotate()</tt> with the exception that values are not circularly shifted.
Instead, zeroes are shifted in where appropriate.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int8 shift(int8 value, uniform int offset)
int16 shift(int16 value, uniform int offset)
int32 shift(int32 value, uniform int offset)
int64 shift(int64 value, uniform int offset)
float shift(float value, uniform int offset)
double shift(double value, uniform int offset)
</pre>
<p>Finally, the <tt class="docutils literal">shuffle()</tt> functions allow two variants of fully general
shuffling of values among the program instances.  For the first version,
each program instance's value of permutation gives the program instance
from which to get the value of <tt class="docutils literal">value</tt>.  The provided values for
<tt class="docutils literal">permutation</tt> must all be between 0 and the gang size.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int8 shuffle(int8 value, int permutation)
int16 shuffle(int16 value, int permutation)
int32 shuffle(int32 value, int permutation)
int64 shuffle(int64 value, int permutation)
float shuffle(float value, int permutation)
double shuffle(double value, int permutation)
</pre>
<p>The second variant of <tt class="docutils literal">shuffle()</tt> permutes over the extended vector that
is the concatenation of the two provided values.  In other words, a value
of 0 in an element of <tt class="docutils literal">permutation</tt> corresponds to the first element of
<tt class="docutils literal">value0</tt>, the value of two times the gang size, minus one corresponds to
the last element of <tt class="docutils literal">value1</tt>, etc.)</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int8 shuffle(int8 value0, int8 value1, int permutation)
int16 shuffle(int16 value0, int16 value1, int permutation)
int32 shuffle(int32 value0, int32 value1, int permutation)
int64 shuffle(int64 value0, int64 value1, int permutation)
float shuffle(float value0, float value1, int permutation)
double shuffle(double value0, double value1, int permutation)
</pre>
<p>Finally, there are primitive operations that extract and set values in the
SIMD lanes.  You can implement all of the broadcast, rotate, shift, and shuffle
operations described above in this section from these routines, though in
general, not as efficiently.  These routines are useful for implementing
other reductions and cross-lane communication that isn't included in the
above, though.  Given a <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt> value, <tt class="docutils literal">extract()</tt> returns the i'th
element of it as a single <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> value.  .</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform bool extract(bool x, uniform int i)
uniform int8 extract(int8 x, uniform int i)
uniform int16 extract(int16 x, uniform int i)
uniform int32 extract(int32 x, uniform int i)
uniform int64 extract(int64 x, uniform int i)
uniform float extract(float x, uniform int i)
</pre>
<p>Similarly, <tt class="docutils literal">insert</tt> returns a new value
where the <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> th element of <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> has been replaced with the value <tt class="docutils literal">v</tt></p>
<pre class="literal-block">
bool insert(bool x, uniform int i, uniform bool v)

int32 insert(int32 x, uniform int i, uniform int32 v)
int64 insert(int64 x, uniform int i, uniform int64 v)
float insert(float x, uniform int i, uniform float v)
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reductions">
<h2>Reductions</h2>
<p>A number of routines are available to evaluate conditions across the
running program instances.  For example, <tt class="docutils literal">any()</tt> returns <tt class="docutils literal">true</tt> if
the given value <tt class="docutils literal">v</tt> is <tt class="docutils literal">true</tt> for any of the SPMD program
instances currently running, <tt class="docutils literal">all()</tt> returns <tt class="docutils literal">true</tt> if it true
for all of them, and <tt class="docutils literal">none()</tt> returns <tt class="docutils literal">true</tt> if <tt class="docutils literal">v</tt> is always
<tt class="docutils literal">false</tt>.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform bool any(bool v)
uniform bool all(bool v)
uniform bool none(bool v)
</pre>
<p>You can also compute a variety of reductions across the program instances.
For example, the values of the given value in each of the active program
instances are added together by the <tt class="docutils literal">reduce_add()</tt> function.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform int16 reduce_add(int8 x)
uniform unsigned int16 reduce_add(unsigned int8 x)
uniform int32 reduce_add(int16 x)
uniform unsigned int32 reduce_add(unsigned int16 x)
uniform int64 reduce_add(int32 x)
uniform unsigned int64 reduce_add(unsigned int32 x)
uniform int64 reduce_add(int64 x)
uniform unsigned int64 reduce_add(unsigned int64 x)

uniform float reduce_add(float x)
uniform double reduce_add(double x)
</pre>
<p>You can also use functions to compute the minimum value of the given value
across all of the currently-executing program instances.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform int32 reduce_min(int32 a)
uniform unsigned int32 reduce_min(unsigned int32 a)
uniform int64 reduce_min(int64 a)
uniform unsigned int64 reduce_min(unsigned int64 a)

uniform float reduce_min(float a)
uniform double reduce_min(double a)
</pre>
<p>Equivalent functions are available to comptue the maximum of the given
varying variable over the active program instances.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform int32 reduce_max(int32 a)
uniform unsigned int32 reduce_max(unsigned int32 a)
uniform int64 reduce_max(int64 a)
uniform unsigned int64 reduce_max(unsigned int64 a)

uniform float reduce_max(float a)
uniform double reduce_max(double a)
</pre>
<p>Finally, you can check to see if a particular value has the same value in
all of the currently-running program instances:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform bool reduce_equal(int32 v)
uniform bool reduce_equal(unsigned int32 v)
uniform bool reduce_equal(int64 v)
uniform bool reduce_equal(unsigned int64 v)

uniform bool reduce_equal(float v)
uniform bool reduce_equal(double)
</pre>
<p>There are also variants of these functions that return the value as a
<tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> in the case where the values are all the same.  (There is
discussion of an application of this variant to improve memory access
performance in the <a class="reference external" href="perfguide.html#understanding-gather-and-scatter">Performance Guide</a>.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform bool reduce_equal(int32 v, uniform int32 * uniform sameval)

uniform bool reduce_equal(float v, uniform float * uniform sameval)
uniform bool reduce_equal(double, uniform double * uniform sameval)
</pre>
<p>If called when none of the program instances are running,
<tt class="docutils literal">reduce_equal()</tt> will return <tt class="docutils literal">false</tt>.</p>
<p>There are also a number of functions to compute &quot;scan&quot;s of values across
the program instances.  For example, the <tt class="docutils literal">exclusive_scan_add()</tt> function
computes, for each program instance, the sum of the given value over all of
the preceding program instances.  (The scans currently available in
<tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> are all so-called &quot;exclusive&quot; scans, meaning that the value
computed for a given element does not include the value provided for that
element.)  In C code, an exclusive add scan over an array might be
implemented as:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
void scan_add(int *in_array, int *result_array, int count) {
    result_array[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i &lt; count; ++i)
        result_array[i] = result_array[i-1] + in_array[i-1];
}
</pre>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> provides the following scan functions--addition, bitwise-and, and
bitwise-or are available:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int32 exclusive_scan_add(int32 v)
unsigned int32 exclusive_scan_add(unsigned int32 v)

unsigned int32 exclusive_scan_or(unsigned int32 v)
int64 exclusive_scan_or(int64 v)
unsigned int64 exclusive_scan_or(unsigned int64 v)
</pre>
<p>The returned value for the first program instance will be <tt class="docutils literal">0</tt> for
<tt class="docutils literal">exclusive_scan_add</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">exclusive_scan_or</tt>, and have all bits set to
<tt class="docutils literal">1</tt> for <tt class="docutils literal">exclusive_scan_and</tt>.</p>
<p>The use of exclusive scan to generate variable amounts of output from

used to allocate memory on the stack.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">alloca()</tt> function allocates <tt class="docutils literal">size</tt> bytes of space in the stack

<h2>Setting and Copying Values In Memory</h2>
<p>There are a few functions for copying blocks of memory and initializing
values in memory.  Along the lines of the equivalently-named routines in
the C Standard libary, <tt class="docutils literal">memcpy</tt> copies a given number of bytes starting
from a source location in memory to a destination locaiton, where the two
regions of memory are guaranteed by the caller to be non-overlapping.
Alternatively, <tt class="docutils literal">memmove</tt> can be used to copy data if the buffers may
overlap.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
void memcpy(void * uniform dst, void * uniform src, uniform int32 count)
void memmove(void * uniform dst, void * uniform src, uniform int32 count)
void memcpy(void * varying dst, void * varying src, int32 count)
void memmove(void * varying dst, void * varying src, int32 count)
</pre>
<p>Note that there are variants of these functions that take both <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt> pointers.  Also note that <tt class="docutils literal">sizeof(float)</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">sizeof(uniform float)</tt> return different values, so programmers should
take care when calculating <tt class="docutils literal">count</tt>.</p>
<p>To initialize values in memory, the <tt class="docutils literal">memset</tt> routine can be used.  (It
also behaves like the function of the same name in the C Standard Library.)
It sets the given number of bytes of memory starting at the given location
to the value provided.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
void memset(void * uniform ptr, uniform int8 val, uniform int32 count)
void memset(void * varying ptr, int8 val, int32 count)
</pre>
<p>There are also variants of all of these functions that take 64-bit values
for the number of bytes of memory to operate on:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
void memcpy64(void * uniform dst, void * uniform src, uniform int64 count)

<div class="section" id="packed-load-and-store-operations">
<h2>Packed Load and Store Operations</h2>
<p>The standard library also offers routines for writing out and reading in
values from linear memory locations for the active program instances.  The
<tt class="docutils literal">packed_load_active()</tt> functions load consecutive values starting at the
given location, loading one consecutive value for each currently-executing
program instance and storing it into that program instance's <tt class="docutils literal">val</tt>
variable.  They return the total number of values loaded.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform int packed_load_active(uniform int * uniform base,

                               varying unsigned int * uniform val)
</pre>
<p>Similarly, the <tt class="docutils literal">packed_store_active()</tt> functions store the <tt class="docutils literal">val</tt> values
for each program instances that executed the <tt class="docutils literal">packed_store_active()</tt>
call, storing the results consecutively starting at the given location.
They return the total number of values stored.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform int packed_store_active(uniform int * uniform base,
                                int val)
uniform int packed_store_active(uniform unsigned int * uniform base,
                                unsigned int val)
</pre>
<p>There are also <tt class="docutils literal">packed_store_active2()</tt> functions with exactly the same
signatures and the same semantic except that they may write one extra
element to the output array (but still returning the same value as
<tt class="docutils literal">packed_store_active()</tt>). These functions suggest different branch free
implementation on most of supported targets, which usually (but not always)
performs better than <tt class="docutils literal">packed_store_active()</tt>. It's advised to test function
performance on user's scenarios on particular target hardware before using it.</p>
<p>As an example of how these functions can be used, the following code shows
the use of <tt class="docutils literal">packed_store_active()</tt>.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform int negative_indices(uniform float a[], uniform int length,
                             uniform int indices[]) {

            numNeg += packed_store_active(&amp;indices[numNeg], i);
    }
    return numNeg;
}
</pre>
<p>The function takes an array of floating point values <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt>, with length
given by the <tt class="docutils literal">length</tt> parameter.  This function also takes an output
array, <tt class="docutils literal">indices</tt>, which is assumed to be at least as long as <tt class="docutils literal">length</tt>.
It then loops over all of the elements of <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> and, for each element that
is less than zero, stores that element's offset into the <tt class="docutils literal">indices</tt> array.
It returns the total number of negative values.  For example, given an
input array <tt class="docutils literal">a[8] = { 10, <span class="pre">-20,</span> 30, <span class="pre">-40,</span> <span class="pre">-50,</span> <span class="pre">-60,</span> 70, 80 }</tt>, it returns a count
of four negative values, and initializes the first four elements of
<tt class="docutils literal">indices[]</tt> to the values <tt class="docutils literal">{ 1, 3, 4, 5 }</tt> corresponding to the array
indices where <tt class="docutils literal">a[i]</tt> was less than zero.</p>

<div class="section" id="converting-between-array-of-structures-and-structure-of-arrays-layout">
<h2>Converting Between Array-of-Structures and Structure-of-Arrays Layout</h2>
<p>Applications often lay data out in memory in &quot;array of structures&quot; form.
Though convenient in C/C++ code, this layout can make <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> programs
less efficient than they would be if the data was laid out in &quot;structure of
arrays&quot; form.  (See the section <a class="reference external" href="perfguide.html#use-structure-of-arrays-layout-when-possible">Use &quot;Structure of Arrays&quot; Layout When
Possible</a> in the performance guide for extended discussion of this topic.)</p>
<p>The standard library does provide a few functions that efficiently convert
between these two formats, for cases where it's not possible to change the
application to use &quot;structure of arrays layout&quot;.  Consider an array of 3D
(x,y,z) position data laid out in a C array like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
// C++ code
float pos[] = { x0, y0, z0, x1, y1, z1, x2, ... };
</pre>
<p>In an <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> program, we might want to load a set of (x,y,z) values and
do a computation based on them.  The natural expression of this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
extern uniform float pos[];
uniform int base = ...;
float x = pos[base + 3 * programIndex];     // x = { x0 x1 x2 ... }
float y = pos[base + 1 + 3 * programIndex]; // y = { y0 y1 y2 ... }
float z = pos[base + 2 + 3 * programIndex]; // z = { z0 z1 z2 ... }
</pre>
<p>leads to irregular memory accesses and reduced performance.  Alternatively,
the <tt class="docutils literal">aos_to_soa3()</tt> standard library function could be used:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
extern uniform float pos[];
uniform int base = ...;
float x, y, z;
aos_to_soa3(&amp;pos[base], &amp;x, &amp;y, &amp;z);
</pre>
<p>This routine loads three times the gang size values from the given array
starting at the given offset, returning three <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt> results.  There
are <tt class="docutils literal">int32</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">int64</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">float</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">double</tt> variants of this function:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

                 varying int64 * uniform v1, varying int64 * uniform v2)
</pre>
<p>After computation is done, corresponding functions convert back from the
SoA values in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt> variables and write the values back to
the given array, starting at the given offset.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

aos_to_soa3(&amp;pos[base], &amp;x, &amp;y, &amp;z);
// do computation with x, y, z
soa_to_aos3(x, y, z, &amp;pos[base]);
</pre>
<pre class="literal-block">

<p>To use them, half-format data should be loaded into an <tt class="docutils literal">int16</tt> and the
<tt class="docutils literal">half_to_float()</tt> function used to convert it to a 32-bit floating point

<div class="section" id="atomic-operations-and-memory-fences">
<h2>Atomic Operations and Memory Fences</h2>
<p>The standard set of atomic memory operations are provided by the standard
library, including variants to handle both uniform and varying
types as well as &quot;local&quot; and &quot;global&quot; atomics.</p>
<p>Local atomics provide atomic behavior across the program instances in a
gang, but not across multiple gangs or memory operations in different
hardware threads.  To see why they are needed, consider a histogram
calculation where each program instance in the gang computes which bucket a
value lies in and then increments a corresponding counter.  If the code is
written like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform int count[N_BUCKETS] = ...;
float value = ...;
int bucket = clamp(value / N_BUCKETS, 0, N_BUCKETS);
++count[bucket];  // ERROR: undefined behavior if collisions
</pre>
<p>then the program's behavior is undefined: whenever multiple program
instances have values that map to the same value of <tt class="docutils literal">bucket</tt>, then the
effect of the increment is undefined.  (See the discussion in the <a class="reference internal" href="#data-races-within-a-gang">Data
Races Within a Gang</a> section; in the case here, there isn't a sequence
point between one program instance updating <tt class="docutils literal">count[bucket]</tt> and the other
program instance reading its value.)</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">atomic_add_local()</tt> function can be used in this case; as a local
atomic it is atomic across the gang of program instances, such that the
expected result is computed.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
...
int bucket = clamp(value / N_BUCKETS, 0, N_BUCKETS);
atomic_add_local(&amp;count[bucket], 1);
</pre>
<p>It uses this variant of the 32-bit integer atomic add routine:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int32 atomic_add_local(uniform int32 * uniform ptr, int32 delta)
</pre>
<p>The semantics of this routine are typical for an atomic add function: the
pointer here points to a single location in memory (the same one for all
program instances), and for each executing program instance, the value
stored in the location that <tt class="docutils literal">ptr</tt> points to has that program instance's
value &quot;delta&quot; added to it atomically, and the old value at that location is
returned from the function.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that the type of the value being added to is a
<tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> integer, while the increment amount and the return value are
<tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt>.  In other words, the semantics of this call are that each
running program instance individually issues the atomic operation with its
own <tt class="docutils literal">delta</tt> value and gets the previous value back in return.  The
atomics for the running program instances may be issued in arbitrary order;
it's not guaranteed that they will be issued in <tt class="docutils literal">programIndex</tt> order, for
example.</p>
<p>Global atomics are more powerful than local atomics; they are atomic across
both the program instances in the gang as well as atomic across different
gangs and different hardware threads.  For example, for the global variant
of the atomic used above,</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int32 atomic_add_global(uniform int32 * uniform ptr, int32 delta)
</pre>
<p>if multiple processors simultaneously issue atomic adds to the same memory
location, the adds will be serialized by the hardware so that the correct
result is computed in the end.</p>
<p>Here are the declarations of the <tt class="docutils literal">int32</tt> variants of these functions.
There are also <tt class="docutils literal">int64</tt> equivalents as well as variants that take
<tt class="docutils literal">unsigned</tt> <tt class="docutils literal">int32</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">int64</tt> values.</p>

counter (for example, to store results into unique locations in an array).
However, the above code calls the second variant of
<tt class="docutils literal">atomic_add_global()</tt>, which takes a <tt class="docutils literal">uniform int</tt> value to add to the
counter and only performs one atomic operation.  The counter will be
increased by just one, and all program instances will receive the same
value back (thanks to the <tt class="docutils literal">uniform int32</tt> return value being silently
converted to a <tt class="docutils literal">varying int32</tt>.)  Writing the code this way, for example,
will cause the desired atomic add function to be called.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
extern uniform int32 counter;
int32 myCounter = atomic_add_global(&amp;counter, (varying int32)1);
</pre>
<p>There is a third variant of each of these atomic functions that takes a
<tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt> pointer; this allows each program instance to issue an atomic
operation to a possibly-different location in memory.  (Of course, the
proper result is still returned if some or all of them happen to point to
the same location in memory!)</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int32 atomic_add_{local,global}(uniform int32 * varying ptr, int32 value)
int32 atomic_subtract_{local,global}(uniform int32 * varying ptr, int32 value)
int32 atomic_min_{local,global}(uniform int32 * varying ptr, int32 value)
int32 atomic_max_{local,global}(uniform int32 * varying ptr, int32 value)
int32 atomic_and_{local,global}(uniform int32 * varying ptr, int32 value)
int32 atomic_or_{local,global}(uniform int32 * varying ptr, int32 value)
int32 atomic_xor_{local,global}(uniform int32 * varying ptr, int32 value)
int32 atomic_swap_{local,global}(uniform int32 * varying ptr, int32 value)
</pre>
<p>And:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
void *atomic_swap_{local,global}(void * * ptr, void *value)
</pre>
<p>There are also atomic &quot;compare and exchange&quot; functions.  Compare and
exchange atomically compares the value in &quot;val&quot; to &quot;compare&quot;--if they
match, it assigns &quot;newval&quot; to &quot;val&quot;.  In either case, the old value of
&quot;val&quot; is returned.  (As with the other atomic operations, there are also
<tt class="docutils literal">unsigned</tt> and 64-bit variants of this function.  Furthermore, there are
<tt class="docutils literal">float</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">double</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">void *</tt> variants as well.)</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int32 atomic_compare_exchange_{local,global}(uniform int32 * uniform ptr,
                                             int32 compare, int32 newval)
uniform int32 atomic_compare_exchange_{local,global}(uniform int32 * uniform ptr,
                                uniform int32 compare, uniform int32 newval)
</pre>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> also has a standard library routine that inserts a memory barrier
into the code; it ensures that all memory reads and writes prior to be
barrier complete before any reads or writes after the barrier are issued.
See the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/memory-barriers.txt">Linux kernel documentation on memory barriers</a> for an excellent
writeup on the need for and the use of memory barriers in multi-threaded
code.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
void memory_barrier();
</pre>
<p>Note that this barrier is <em>not</em> needed for coordinating reads and writes
among the program instances in a gang; it's only needed for coordinating
between multiple hardware threads running on different cores.  See the
section <a class="reference internal" href="#data-races-within-a-gang">Data Races Within a Gang</a> for the guarantees provided about
memory read/write ordering across a gang.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="prefetches">
<h2>Prefetches</h2>
<p>The standard library has a variety of functions to prefetch data into the
processor's cache.  While modern CPUs have automatic prefetchers that do a
reasonable job of prefetching data to the cache before its needed, high
performance applications may find it helpful to prefetch data before it's
needed.</p>
<p>For example, this code shows how to prefetch data to the processor's L1
cache while iterating over the items in an array.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform int32 array[...];
for (uniform int i = 0; i &lt; count; ++i) {
    // do computation with array[i]
    prefetch_l1(&amp;array[i+32]);
}
</pre>
<p>The standard library has routines to prefetch to the L1, L2, and L3
caches.  It also has a variant, <tt class="docutils literal">prefetch_nt()</tt>, that indicates that the
value being prefetched isn't expected to be used more than once (so should
be high priority to be evicted from the cache).  Furthermore, it has
versions of these functions that take both <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt>
pointer types.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
void prefetch_{l1,l2,l3,nt}(void * uniform ptr)
void prefetch_{l1,l2,l3,nt}(void * varying ptr)
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="system-information">
<h2>System Information</h2>
<p>The value of a  high-precision hardware clock counter is returned by the
<tt class="docutils literal">clock()</tt> routine; its value increments by one each processor cycle.
Thus, taking the difference between the values returned by <tt class="docutils literal">clock()</tt> at
different points in program execution gives the number of cycles between
those points in the program.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform int64 clock()
</pre>
<p>Note that <tt class="docutils literal">clock()</tt> flushes the processor pipeline.  It has an overhead
of a hundred or so cycles, so for very fine-grained measurements, it may be
worthwhile to measure the cost of calling <tt class="docutils literal">clock()</tt> and subtracting that
value from reported results.</p>
<p>A routine is also available to find the number of CPU cores available in
the system:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform int num_cores()

<div class="section" id="interoperability-with-the-application">
<h1>Interoperability with the Application</h1>
<p>One of <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>'s key goals is to make it easy to interoperate between the
C/C++ application code and parallel code written in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>.  This
section describes the details of how this works and describes a number of
the pitfalls.</p>
<div class="section" id="interoperability-overview">
<h2>Interoperability Overview</h2>
<p>As described in <a class="reference internal" href="#compiling-and-running-a-simple-ispc-program">Compiling and Running a Simple ISPC Program</a> it's
relatively straightforward to call <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> code from C/C++.  First, any
<tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> functions to be called should be defined with the <tt class="docutils literal">export</tt>
keyword:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
export void foo(uniform float a[]) {
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>This function corresponds to the following C-callable function:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
void foo(float a[]);
</pre>
<p>(Recall from the <a class="reference internal" href="#uniform-and-varying-qualifiers">&quot;uniform&quot; and &quot;varying&quot; Qualifiers</a> section
that <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> types correspond to a single instances of the
corresponding type in C/C++.)</p>
<p>In addition to variables passed from the application to <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> in the
function call, you can also share global variables between the application
and <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>.  To do so, just declare the global variable as usual (in
either <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> or application code), and add an <tt class="docutils literal">extern</tt> declaration on
the other side.</p>
<p>For example, given this <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> code:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
// ispc code
uniform float foo;
extern uniform float bar[10];
</pre>
<p>And this C++ code:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
// C++ code
extern &quot;C&quot; {
  extern float foo;
  float bar[10];
}
</pre>
<p>Both the <tt class="docutils literal">foo</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">bar</tt> global variables can be accessed on each
side.  Note that the <tt class="docutils literal">extern &quot;C&quot;</tt> declaration is necessary from C++,
since <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> uses C linkage for functions and globals.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> code can also call back to C/C++.  On the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> side, any
application functions to be called must be declared with the <tt class="docutils literal">extern &quot;C&quot;</tt>
qualifier.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
extern &quot;C&quot; void foo(uniform float f, uniform float g);
</pre>
<p>Unlike in C++, <tt class="docutils literal">extern &quot;C&quot;</tt> doesn't take braces to delineate
multiple functions to be declared; thus, multiple C functions to be called
from <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> must be declared as follows:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
extern &quot;C&quot; void foo(uniform float f, uniform float g);
extern &quot;C&quot; uniform int bar(uniform int a);
</pre>
<p>It is illegal to overload functions declared with <tt class="docutils literal">extern &quot;C&quot;</tt> linkage;
<tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> issues an error in this case.</p>
<p>Functions declared with <tt class="docutils literal">extern &quot;C&quot;</tt> linkage can be made to follow
<tt class="docutils literal">__vectorcall</tt> calling convention on Windows by using <tt class="docutils literal">__vectorcall</tt>
qualifier.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
extern &quot;C&quot; __vectorcall void foo(uniform float f, uniform float g);
</pre>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">__vectorcall</tt> can only be used for <tt class="docutils literal">extern &quot;C&quot;</tt> function declarations and
on Windows OS.</p>
<p><strong>Only a single function call is made back to C++ for the entire gang of
running program instances</strong>.  Furthermore, function calls back to C/C++ are not
made if none of the program instances want to make the call.  For example,
given code like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uniform float foo = ...;
float x = ...;
if (x != 0)
    foo = appFunc(foo);
</pre>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">appFunc()</tt> will only be called if one or more of the running program
instances evaluates <tt class="docutils literal">true</tt> for <tt class="docutils literal">x != 0</tt>.  If the application code would
like to determine which of the running program instances want to make the
call, a mask representing the active SIMD lanes can be passed to the
function.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
extern &quot;C&quot; float appFunc(uniform float x,
                         uniform int activeLanes);
</pre>
<p>If the function is then called as:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
...
x = appFunc(x, lanemask());
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">activeLanes</tt> parameter will have the value one in the 0th bit if the
first program instance is running at this point in the code, one in the
first bit for the second instance, and so forth.  (The <tt class="docutils literal">lanemask()</tt>
function is documented in <a class="reference internal" href="#cross-program-instance-operations">Cross-Program Instance Operations</a>.)
Application code can thus be written as:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
float appFunc(float x, int activeLanes) {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; programCount; ++i)
        if ((activeLanes &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; i)) != 0) {
            // do computation for i'th SIMD lane
        }
}
</pre>
<p>In some cases, it can be desirable to generate a single call for each
executing program instance, rather than one call for a gang.  For example,
the code below shows how one might call an existing math library routine
that takes a scalar parameter.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
extern &quot;C&quot; uniform double erf(uniform double);
double v = ...;
double result;
foreach_active (instance) {
    uniform double r = erf(extract(v, instance));
    result = insert(result, instance, r);
}
</pre>
<p>This code calls <tt class="docutils literal">erf()</tt> once for each active program instance, passing it
the program instance's value of <tt class="docutils literal">v</tt> and storing the result in the
instance's <tt class="docutils literal">result</tt> value.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-layout">
<h2>Data Layout</h2>
<p>In general, <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> tries to ensure that <tt class="docutils literal">struct</tt> types and other
complex datatypes are laid out in the same way in memory as they are in
C/C++.  Matching structure layout is important for easy interoperability
between C/C++ code and <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> code.</p>
<p>The main complexity in sharing data between <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> and C/C++ often comes
from reconciling data structures between <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> code and application
code; it can be useful to declare the shared structures in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> code
and then examine the generated header file (which will have the C/C++
equivalents of them.)  For example, given a structure in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
// ispc code
struct Node {
   int count;
   float pos[3];
};
</pre>
<p>If a <tt class="docutils literal">uniform Node</tt> structure is used in the parameters to an <tt class="docutils literal">export</tt>
ed function, then the header file generated by the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> compiler will
have a declaration like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
// C/C++ code
struct Node {
   int count;
   float pos[3];
};
</pre>
<p>Because <tt class="docutils literal">varying</tt> types have size that depends on the size of the gang of
program instances, <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> has restrictrictions on using varying types in
parameters to functions with the <tt class="docutils literal">export</tt> qualifier.  <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> prohibits
parameters to exported functions to have varying type unless the parameter is
of pointer type.  (That is, <tt class="docutils literal">varying float</tt> isn't allowed, but <tt class="docutils literal">varying float * uniform</tt>
(uniform pointer to varying float) is permitted.)  Care must be taken
by the programmer to ensure that the data being accessed through any
pointers to varying data has the correct organization.</p>
<p>Similarly, <tt class="docutils literal">struct</tt> types shared with the application can also have
embedded pointers.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
// C code
struct Foo {
    float *foo, *bar;
};
</pre>
<p>On the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> side, the corresponding <tt class="docutils literal">struct</tt> declaration is:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
// ispc
struct Foo {
    float * uniform foo, * uniform bar;
};
</pre>
<p>If a pointer to a varying <tt class="docutils literal">struct</tt> type appears in an exported function,
the generated header file will have a definition like (for 8-wide SIMD):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
// C/C++ code
struct Node {
  int count[8];
  float pos[3][8];
};
</pre>
<p>In the case of multiple target compilation, <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> will generate multiple
header files and a &quot;general&quot; header file with definitions for multiple sizes.
Any pointers to varyings in exported functions will be rewritten as <tt class="docutils literal">void *</tt>.
At runtime, the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> dispatch mechanism will cast these pointers to the appropriate
types.  Programmers can
provide C/C++ code with a mechanism to determine the gang width used
at runtime by <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> by creating an exported function that simply
returns the value of <tt class="docutils literal">programCount</tt>.  An example of such a function
is provided in the file <tt class="docutils literal">examples/util/util.isph</tt> included in the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>
distribution.</p>
<p>There is one subtlety related to data layout to be aware of: <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>
stores <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> short-vector types in memory with their first element at
the machine's natural vector alignment (i.e. 16 bytes for a target that is
using Intel® SSE, and so forth.)  This implies that these types will have
different layout on different compilation targets.  As such, applications
should in general avoid accessing <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt> short vector types from C/C++
application code if possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-alignment-and-aliasing">
<h2>Data Alignment and Aliasing</h2>
<p>There are two important constraints that must be adhered to when
passing pointers from the application to <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> programs.</p>
<p>The first is that it is required that it be valid to read memory at the
first element of any array that is passed to <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>.  In practice, this
should just happen naturally, but it does mean that it is illegal to pass a
<tt class="docutils literal">NULL</tt> pointer as a parameter to a <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> function called from the
application.</p>
<p>The second constraint is that pointers and references in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> programs
must not alias.  The <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> compiler assumes that different pointers
can't end up pointing to the same memory location, either due to having the
same initial value, or through array indexing in the program as it
executed.</p>
<p>This aliasing constraint also applies to <tt class="docutils literal">reference</tt> parameters to
functions.  Given a function like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
void func(int &amp;a, int &amp;b) {
    a = 0;
    if (b == 0) { ... }
}
</pre>
<p>Then the same variable must not be passed to <tt class="docutils literal">func()</tt>.  This is
another case of aliasing, and if the caller calls the function as <tt class="docutils literal">func(x,
x)</tt>, it's not guaranteed that the <tt class="docutils literal">if</tt> test will evaluate to true, due
to the compiler's requirement of no aliasing.</p>
<p>(In the future, <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> will have a mechanism to indicate that pointers
may alias.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="restructuring-existing-programs-to-use-ispc">
<h2>Restructuring Existing Programs to Use ISPC</h2>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> is designed to enable you to incorporate
SPMD parallelism into existing code with minimal modification; features
like the ability to share memory and data structures between C/C++ and
<tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> code and the ability to directly call back and forth between
<tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> and C/C++ are motivated by this.  These features also make it
easy to incrementally transform a program to use <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>; the most
computationally-intensive localized parts of the computation can be
transformed into <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> code while the remainder of the system is left
as is.</p>
<p>For a given section of code to be transitioned to run in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>, the
next question is how to parallelize the computation.  Generally, there will
be obvious loops inside which a large amount of computation is done (&quot;for
each ray&quot;, &quot;for each pixel&quot;, etc.)  Mapping these to the SPMD computational
style is often effective.</p>
<p>Carefully choose how to do the exact mapping of computation to SPMD program
instances.  This choice can impact the mix of gather/scatter memory access
versus coherent memory access, for example.  (See more on this topic in the
<a class="reference external" href="http://ispc.github.io/perfguide.html">ispc Performance Tuning Guide</a>.)  This decision can also impact the
coherence of control flow across the running SPMD program instances, which
can also have a significant effect on performance; in general, creating
groups of work that will tend to do similar computation across the SPMD
program instances improves performance.</p>
